There was chaos on Monday morning at University of South Africa’s (Unisa) Sunnyside campus in Pretoria following the institution’s announcement on Friday to open its doors for walk-in applications. Unisa spokesperson Martin Ramotshela told EWN the university management was on the ground trying to mediate between the Progressive Youth Alliance (PYA) and Economic Freedom Fighters Student Command (EFFSC). While Jacaranda News reported that Unisa management called on students to go home and return back to the institution on Tuesday to register. “There seems to be a power struggle between two opposing student formations. Some want students to go in, and others don’t, and currently the university management is on the ground trying to mediate between the two student groupings so that we are able to open and service the students who have in to apply or register,” Ramotshela said. On Friday, members of the EFFSC at Unisa threatened a total shutdown of the institution if the promise of free education announced by President Jacob Zuma last year is not rolled out. Meanwhile, last Thursday a number of prospective students from around Limpopo were injured during a stampede at the Capricorn FET College. The stampede happened when applicants jostled for access to the institution. For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter. Read original story on citizen.co.za
