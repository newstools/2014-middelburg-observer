African National Congress (ANC) treasurer-general Zweli Mkhize has warned divisions driven by factions within the ruling party could risk seeing the party lose power come the 2019 general elections, TimesLIVE reports.Speaking at a Congress of South African Trade Union (Cosatu) Workers Day event in Cape Town on Monday, at the Castle of Good Hope, Mkhize said it was still too early for the ANC to be removed from power through the ballot 23-years since the country s democratic dispensation. The threat for us to be unseated out of power is higher if we are divided. The threat of us being able to continue to manage the affairs of our country is undermined by our divisions factionalism must be gotten rid off Mkhize was quoted as saying.He urged the ANC and its alliance partners, Cosatu and the SACP, to resolve their differences and make sure the party s upcoming national elective conference to be held later this year in December becomes a unifying experience. It is not right for the ANC to get out of power. We are not the right generation to lose power in this country. We are the generation that actually fought in the trenches to bring about this democracy our revolution depends on us working together he said. Caxton News ServiceRead original story on citizen.co.za
