South Gauteng High Court in Johannesburg on Wednesday ruled that schools in the country were not permitted to promote one religion, reports The Citizen.This follows an application brought against six schools by the Organisation for Religious Education and Democracy (OGOD), which alleged there was religious bias in public schools and pupils were being taught to be religious instead of learning about diverse religions.Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga supported the application and argued in court papers that schools were not permitted to focus on just one religion.The case was opposed by the Federation of Governing Bodies of South African Schools and trade union Solidarity, which represented the six schools.The union argued before the high court that 24 000 schools in the country would be affected by the ruling.This is a developing story.
