Tourists were greeted with the grisly sight of a mutilated elephant corpse lying on the road just outside Satara this morning in Mpumalanga, Lowvelder reports. Police and SANParks environmental investigators are on the scene, about one kilometre outside Satara. The elephant corpse was spotted by tourists this morning. “At this point in time it seems as though the animal was killed by predators, such as lions,” said Skukuza police spokesperson Warrant Officer Willie Broodryk. Poaching and a possible muti killing is not suspected, but a full investigation will confirm how the animal died. – Caxton News Service Read original story on lowvelder.co.za
