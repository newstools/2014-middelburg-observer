The department of basic education said its website has been hacked and graphic pictures of corpses were posted some of them of children, reports The Citizen. We distance ourselves from the brutal images that incite hatred and violence, read a statement issued by the government communications on behalf of the department. We have taken immediate steps to have the images removed from our website and to investigate how the website has been hacked. A message accompanying the gory photographs reads: A message to the government, the American people and the rest of the world. Is this the humanity that you claim, or is life irrelevant to Muslims? Do not imagine that these actions against Muslims will pass you and we will forget what you did to the Arab and Muslim peoples all over the world. I love Islamic State. After closing the website to restore it, the department said: We condemn such acts in the strongest terms. In the meantime, we appeal to members of the public to be patient with us.
