The City of Cape Town s traffic service has busted an unlicensed driver operating in contravention of his operating licence, driving a taxi overloaded with 32 passengers.There were 14 passengers standing in the vehicle.The City of Cape Town media office said the officers who were on point duty at the intersection of Chestnut Way and Erica Drive in Belhar on June 15 found the driver to be committing several violations of the National Road Traffic Act and stopped the vehicle.Watch as the officers count the astonishing number of people in the taxi:The driver was arrested and the vehicle was impounded.The City s mayoral committee member for safety and security, and social services, Alderman JP Smith, said it was an absolutely shocking incident . While I understand that there is immense pressure on the public transport system as well as the people who rely on it to get to work, there is no excuse for this type of behaviour. I shudder to think of the consequences if that vehicle had to be in a collision. I appeal to the public to please steer clear of overloaded vehicles, for their own safety and that of others. Incidents like these do nothing for the reputation of the taxi industry and so I also call on owners and associations to address this type of lawlessness.
