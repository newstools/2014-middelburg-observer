Former Pretoria High Court Judge Mabel Jansen, who made headlines last year for her controversial comments on Facebook about rape being part of black culture, on Thursday resigned with immediate effect, the department of justice said. Judge Mabel Jansen has written to the President [Jacob Zuma] and the Minister of Justice and Correctional Services, Adv Michael Masutha, informing them of her resignation with immediate effect, a statement from the department said. Minister Masutha has acknowledged the letter, thanked her for her valuable service and is processing the letter for the President s attention. In May last year, Jansen was exposed by social activist Gillian Schutte following a Facebook conversation they had in 2015, in which the judge said of black men: In their culture, a woman is there to pleasure them. Period. It is seen as an absolute right and a woman s consent is not required. I still have to meet a black girl who was not raped at about 12. I am dead serious.
