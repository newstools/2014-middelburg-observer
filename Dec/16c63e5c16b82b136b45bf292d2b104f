The African National Congress Women s League (ANCWL) has, in a radical statement, called for unity across the political divide to defeat white supremacy in the country, reports The Citizen.In a rhetoric reminiscent of the stance of the rival Economic Freedom Fighters, ANCWL secretary-general Meokgo Matuba on Friday suggested radical land redistribution and for more than 50% of government contracts to be procured from black enterprises.The latter is a radical shift from the ANC s initial 30%, announced recently by President Jacob Zuma during the ANC s January 8 statement. South Africans, in particular black people, are tired of delaying tactics by some whites who want to divert any government programmes of radical transformation, said Matuba. This unity and peace olive branch might not be extended any further. The league was reacting to the decision by the Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse (Outa) and the South African Airways Pilots Association to apply for a court order to have South African Airways (SAA) board chairperson Dudu Myeni declared a delinquent director, who grossly abused her position.The organisations said the airline had lost more than R10 billion under Myeni s leadership.The league lashed out at Outa, accusing it of rushing to court against Myeni, while it failed to challenge the activities of collusion by business cartels, citing current cases in the construction and banking sectors, as well as the latest revelation about anticompetition activities by recruitment specialists. The deafening silence of this organisation on these matters might be interpreted as a conscious decision not to challenge any white person who is leading in those institutions and to protect whiteness, Matuba said.
