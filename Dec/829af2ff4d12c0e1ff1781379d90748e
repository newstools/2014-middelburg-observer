African National Congress MP and former tourism minister Derek Hanekom on Wednesday expressed his view over the unfolding political situation in Zimbabwe after the country’s army took power and placed President Robert Mugabe under house arrest. Hanekom, one of the most vocal social media users on politics, tweeted: “Maybe there is a message from Zimbabwe – Presidents should not push their luck too far.”  But it was not the MPs’ views on the 93-year-old veteran – once seen as a liberation hero – that got tweeps talking. ANC national executive committee (NEC) member Tony Yengeni joined the fray and commented on Hanekom’s tweet, sparking a mini Twitter war between the two members of the ANC’s highest decision-making body.  – Caxton News Service Read original story on citizen.co.za
