The ANC in the Northern Cape has proposed a radical redesign of top brass structures to enable the organisation to function smoothly and further suggested a presidential commission to probe restructuring of provincial governments, reports The Citizen.The province decided at its special provincial general council at the weekend that the national executive committee (NEC) should be reduced to 40 members, instead of the current 80, while the national working committee (NWC) must be replaced by a task-oriented revolutionary council .Provincial secretary Deshi Ngxanga said the special provincial general meeting held in Kimberley this weekend proposed that the revolutionary council report to the NEC quarterly. The province further suggested a broader top nine leadership structure to replace the current top six officials.Its position was in line with views expressed earlier in the political overview by ANC provincial chairperson Zamani Saul at the provincial general council.Saul questioned whether the NEC structure comprising the top six and NWC were appropriate for the party to function effectively. He said the current NWC setup was an unnecessary appendage and had no specific tasks. With the current challenges confronting the movement, we need to consider restructuring the working committee into a revolutionary council with taskassigned members, Saul said.The provincial general council adopted Saul s suggestions that the revolutionary council should comprise the party president, two deputy presidents, the secretary-general, three deputy secretary-generals, the national chairperson and treasurer-general.He said the current provincial set-up was a fiscus guzzler that went against the ANC s historic mission of a unitary state.Saul added the question of radical economic transformation would form part of the second phase of revolution after the National Democratic Revolution.
