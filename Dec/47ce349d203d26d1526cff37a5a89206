She then allegedly tried to poison her stepfather with Blue Death insect poison by putting it in his drink.After Eva Beetge went to sleep, her daughter allegedly let her two co-accused into the house, where they allegedly attacked Eva Beetge in the living room, strangling her.All three accused then allegedly went to Piet Beetge s bedroom where they attacked him with a brick and strangled him. The bodies were then allegedly loaded into their car and dumped in the Hennopspruit.Lekalakala and her boyfriend then allegedly took her mother s ATM card and withdrew R500. Two cellphones, a digital camera, laptop and other items were allegedly also removed from the house. Caxton News ServiceRead original story on citizen.co.za
