KwaZulu-Natal MEC for Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs (Cogta) Nomusa Dube-Ncube has expressed her disappointment that some municipalities are still not complying with the 2014 regulations on the appointment of senior managers, there still seems to be numerous vacancies. Dube-Ncube recently addressed KZN’s mayors and municipal managers during a regular Munimec meeting in Durban. “The senior management vacancy rate in KZN municipalities is currently at 36.5% – that is 110 vacancies out of 301 senior management posts in municipalities across the province. Of these, 26 municipal manager and 16 chief financial officer posts are vacant. I urge all mayors to prioritise these appointments as municipalities cannot function properly without them,” said Dube-Ncube. Municipalities have been advised on numerous occasions on the process to follow to fill their critical posts even while they await the expiry of current employment contracts to ensure that municipal management posts are occupied at all times. Despite the efforts, some municipalities still continue to not comply and progress in the filling of critical vacancies is slow. “At the same time, it is very disappointing that only 68 (or 23%) of the 301 senior management posts in KZN municipalities are occupied by women. Mayors are urged to consider their employment equity plans in the appointment of senior managers to ensure gender and demographic representativeness in their senior management,” said Dube-Ncube. Munimec is a regular inter-governmental forum where the MEC for Cogta interacts with the province’s mayors and senior municipal officials. In addition to the filling of critical senior management vacancies and gender equity disparities, todas meeting has also debated issues pertaining to integrity and ethics management, public procurement, water restrictions, housing and job creation.
