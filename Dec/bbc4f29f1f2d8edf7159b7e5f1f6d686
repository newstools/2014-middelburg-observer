National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) head Shaun Abrahams has reportedly given President Jacob Zuma until the end of January next year to file his representations on why he should not be prosecuted on 783 counts of corruption, fraud, money-laundering and racketeering over the controversial arms deal saga. Zuma was scheduled to file his representations by November 30 after the Supreme Court of Appeal ruled that the decision by Abrahams’ predecessor Mokotedi Mpshe to drop the charges against Zuma in April 2009 was unlawful. According to eNCA legal journalist Karyn Maughan, Zuma’s lawyers asked for the postponement for the filing of fresh reasons on why he should not be prosecuted because of “prior litigation commitments” and because of the “complexity” that needed to be addressed in his representations.       – Caxton News Service  For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
