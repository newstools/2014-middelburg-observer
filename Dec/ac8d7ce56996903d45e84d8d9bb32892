Judge Sheila Mphahlele sentenced Willem Oosthuyzen to an effective 11 years in prison and his co-accused Theo Jackson to 14 years behind bars. In August the pair were found guilty of assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm‚ attempted murder‚ intimidation and kidnapping. The court heard the men had infringed on the victims’, Delton Sithole and Victor Mlotshwa human rights and showed little remorse for the crime. Shortly after the sentence was handed down, state prosecutor advocate Robert Molokoane applied for a limit to be placed on when the accused could apply for parole or correctional supervision. The court denied the application. Thereafter defence advocates Wanye Gibbs and Org Basson brought an application for leave to appeal. Judge Mpahlele is expected to make her decision shortly.

The two victims, Sithole and Mlotshwa both required to receive a written apology as well as compensation from the coffin assault duo. Read original story on mobserver.co.za
