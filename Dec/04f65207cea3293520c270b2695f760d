Saturday marked one week since the five-year-old boy fell down an Ekurhuleni mine shaft and, as the South African Defence Force (SANDF) compiles its report for an informed decision to be made on the way forward, wet weather conditions pose yet another challenge, reports The Citizen.The City of Ekurhuleni mayoral spokesperson, Gugu Ndima, said on Friday rescue efforts were halted as wet weather created a high risk on the already fragile surface.They were also awaiting the report from the SANDF, which should be completed by Monday.Ekurhuleni mayor Mzwandile Masina wrote to the defence minister on Wednesday after a report presented to him revealed that further expertise was needed for the rescue efforts.Members of the SANDF were given a technical overview offsite, as well as a visual assessment onsite on Thursday in briefings attended by Mine Rescue Services, the department of mineral resources, the provincial disaster management centre, DRD Gold and the City of Ekurhuleni.Ekurhuleni Disaster and Emergency Management Services (Edems) spokesperson William Ntladi explained rescue technicians confronted many challenges, such as rock falls, unstable ground, oxygen deficiency from a depth of 36m, gas emissions from the acid mine water and the depth of the decline shaft.The mine shaft drama started to unfold at around midday last Saturday when the young boy was playing with some friends at the edge of the opening, which is located in the Jerusalem informal settlement near Witfield.Ntladi said the ground above the previously closed shaft had caved in about two to three weeks before the incident.Ndima said the city had not received any official communication regarding the shaft s opening prior to the incident of the boy s fall.The area around the opening is littered with rubble and rubbish.Ntladi said it was thought the children were throwing items into the opening when the boy fell. He added the child who reported the incident was traumatised and received medical treatment.Edems first attended the scene on Saturday, and rescue efforts resumed on Sunday.By Sunday night, there was no sign of the boy and rescue services were suspended for the day, but residents were not pleased, and they took to Wit Deep Road to protest, blocking the road with stones, burning tyres and wood. Rescue efforts resumed on Monday and throughout the week but to no avail.The boy s mother, Nombeko Thole, described her son, Richard, as a happy, active child. I wish that they can dig up my child and bring him to me, Thole said. Caxton News ServiceRead original story on citizen.co.za
