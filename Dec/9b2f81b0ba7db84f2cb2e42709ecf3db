Heather van Heerden, owner of the world famous baobab tree, has stated that a week ago the trunk split off another third of its trunk, Letaba Herald reports.The first third broke off late last year.Two scientists who have been studying the tree over the past 10 years, Dr Stephan Woodborne and Professor Adrian Patrut, went to see the tree on March 21. The side that collapsed consists of the younger wood. This portion, which housed the pub, is only 850 years old. The tree is reported to have done the same thing 850 years ago, after which it regrew again. The older side of the tree is still standing and still looks magical. That wood is radiocarbon-dated to be 1,700 years old, and we are hoping that the fallen stems will root themselves, van Heerden says.Another major section of the famous Sunland Baobab has split off and crashed to the ground last week, destroying the pub enclosed inside the trunk.&nbsp;Another major section of the famous Sunland Baobab has split off and crashed to the ground last week, destroying the pub enclosed inside the trunk.Seven out of 10 of the huge baobabs in Africa have collapsed over the last couple of years.Among them are the Chapman s Baobab (Botswana), Glenhove (Hoedspruit) and a 28m baobab in rural Zambia.
