The Tshwane bus service will return to normal operations on Monday, after staff members embarked on a protest on Thursday morning, leaving Pretoria commuters stranded. The city said its workers, including senior operators, artisans and general workers, were unhappy about unpaid overtime and the outsourcing of work to external companies. The protesters blocked the main gate at the C de Wet depot with two trucks on Thursday and the city spokesperson, Selby Bokaba said only three of the 105 buses were able to leave the depot that morning. Commuters in Centurion, Olievenhoutbosch, Danville, Pretoria East and Lotus Gardens were affected by the protest. Bokaba said the bus service was running at 30% capacity, but would have all its staff members back on duty on Monday. “Come Monday we will be operating at full capacity as the dispute has been resolved,” he said. The city agreed to pay workers outstanding overtime and committed to sign a service level agreement with the companies from whom services were outsourced. The metro spokesperson said the management was unaware of the staff’s decision to protest and demonstrate while airing their grievances. “We once more apologise to our bus commuters for the inconvenience they endured as a result of the strike,” Bokaba said Read original story on rekordeast.co.za
