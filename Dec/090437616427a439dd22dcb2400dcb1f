Known as the white sangoma, Bronwyn Saayman has been practising for more than 10 years, and after a spell in the mountains, she is back in Fourways.Having spent the last few years in the Magaliesberg Mountains in the Hartbeespoort area, now she is ready to again help people who are struggling to help themselves, the Fourways Review reported.Giving some background, Saayman said from a young age she was in touch with the spiritual world and that her family was involved in spiritual service their whole life.Saayman began her sangoma training in 2009 and has thrown herself into her work since the day she started her journey. About three months ago, she went through a difficult time after she suffered a stroke and has been recovering in Fourways.She is now ready to get back to her calling. I have a job to do, I live to make the lives of others better, Saayman said.She said being a sangoma can take a physical and emotional strain because they dedicate so much of their time and energy to their clients.She added sangomas have developed a bad reputation because of the use of black magic, and also due to the public s ignorance. As a white woman who is a sangoma, some people have criticised Saayman s way of living on social media, which is why she has developed a passion for education and wants to warn people about the use of black magic and teach them about positive sangoma practices.Sangoma Bronwyn Saayman throws the bones.She has appeared on numerous television shows in the past and plans to partner with the media to educate people about her practices.Although Saayman admits there are sangomas who exploit people, she wants to put the emphasis on those who practise for a good cause, and that is to help people. If people just know what the symptoms [of spiritual attack] are, then people will understand why certain things are happening in their lives, she said.According to Saayman, spiritual attacks usually occur in people s finances, relationships and health.Saayman cited sleep as an example, and said there is a reason why you cannot sleep or why you suffer from sleep paralysis and she is able to help you to figure out why.Saayman emphasised that she does not use endangered species, only indigenous medicinal healing plants.Details: Sangoma Bronwyn Saayman 072 555 5131.
