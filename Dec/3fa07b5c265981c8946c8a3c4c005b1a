President Jacob Zuma appeared unfazed during the unveiling ceremony of a tombstone for the late minister in the presidency Collins Chabane, in Limpopo, in spite of opposition parties threatening to cut him down to size during the upcoming vote of no confidence against him next week.Zuma assured the more than 5 000 people at the unveiling that he would lead the ANC until his term lapses during the party s elective conference in December.He said he didn t regret his contentious Cabinet reshuffle in which five ministers, including finance minister Pravin Gordhan and his deputy, Mcebisi Jonas, were fired. There will always be those who would oppose some of the informed decisions I take. This in spite of the fact that my decisions are informed by policy and the constitution of South Africa, said Zuma.Held at the Shikundu sports ground, 15km from Malamulele, at the foot of the Kruger National Park, the unveiling was attended by, among others, ANC treasurer-general Zweli Mkhize, Cooperative Governance Minister Des van Rooyen, Limpopo Premier Stanley Mathabatha, former Eskom chief executive and now MP Brian Molefe, newly appointed Transport Minister Joe Maswanganyi and a host of MECs, chiefs and religious leaders.Chabane died in a car accident on the N1 highway between Polokwane and Mokopane on March 15, in 2015.Zuma described Chabane as an articulate and fearless cadre, who knew the politics of the ANC inside out. He said Chabane was an active members of the Warriors 7, who worked alongside the likes of the late ANC Youth League president Peter Mokoba.He said Chabane was known as an active member of the ANC from a young age, and served as an adviser and a shoulder to cry on during the struggles that brought about freedom in South Africa. He would articulate and always took informed decisions that would, in turn, guide the Warriors 7 while in exile. I can see from the songs sung by his daughter and the exuberant speech rendered by his son that Chabane is well represented. For some of you who don t know, Chabane was a musician and a renowned public speaker, just like his son and daughter, said Zuma.The president also took a swipe at ANC factions that used the name of late political leaders for their political endeavours. I would like to commend the people of Limpopo for not using Chabane s name to score their cheap political points. Chabane has worked so much for the people of Limpopo and the country at large, and his name has to be respected, said Zuma. Caxton News ServiceRead original story on citizen.co.za
