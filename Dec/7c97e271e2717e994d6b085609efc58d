A memorial service was held for a young Bredell man on Thursday who died after contracting malaria. His friend is still in hospital recovering from the same disease. Cleo de Klerk (25), who died on October 6, had never left Kempton Park and it is unclear how he contracted the disease. According to De Klerk’s girlfriend of the past two years, Tanyia Mangiagalli, Cleo started showing flue-like symptoms on September 29. As his condition did not improve, he visited a doctor who diagnosed malaria, a family member, who did not want to be named, said. De Klerk was admitted to a normal ward at Tembisa Hospital. He was transferred to ICU when a bed became available. He died on Friday morning, October 6. Mangiagalli said Cleo worked in logistics for a Pomona import and export company, where various containers were handled. However, it is not known how and where he contracted the disease. De Klerk and a close friend, who is also from Kempton Park, became sick at the same time. The friends lived about a 10-minute drive from each other. His friend is recovering. De Klerk, an ex-learner of Hoërskool Kempton Park, visited his friend shortly before he fell ill. According to the National Institute for Communicalbe Diseases (NICD), unusual malaria cases, affecting persons with no recent history of travel to malaria transmission areas, have been reported in Pretoria (four patients) and Kempton Park (two patients). It is most likely that Anopheles malaria vector mosquitoes, which had been accidentally transported by vehicles from malaria areas, were responsible. This form of disease is called odyssean malaria, also known as airport, suitcase, minibus or taxi-rank malaria, the NICD said. It is a very rare condition. since 2007, only 71 such cases have been recorded in South Africa, mostly in Gauteng. Read original story on kemptonexpress.co.za
