My wife and I were at work at the time, and my daughter did not go to school as she was ill. She heard my two four-year-old Cocker Spaniel dogs yelping outside, and when she looked, she saw that the bees were attacking one of the dogs. Alistair s daughter Tiara called their neighbours Ravi Govender and Michele Koen for help. Koen said, although she was allergic to bees, she tried her best to save the dog. One of the dogs Ella, which was pregnant, luckily ran up the road a distance away from the house. Milo had taken cover in his kennel, and it looked as though he had given up fighting and accepted that to save everyone, he had to take the stings.
