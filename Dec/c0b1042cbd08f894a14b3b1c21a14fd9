Investigative journalists Jacques Pauw and Pieter-Louis Myburgh are being targeted by authorities as police allegedly attempt to investigate them. Both men were to appear at Durban North Police Station to make statements about their material that extensively details the alleged corrupt relationships involving President Jacob Zuma, reports Times Live. Their attorney, Willem de Klerk, confirmed in a letter that Pauw and Myburgh will not present themselves at the station. “We confirm your request that both Mr Pauw and Mr Myburgh present themselves at Durban North police station in order to answer questions and/or make statements to the matters under investigation. “Our clients are not at this stage willing to answer questions or make statements, but would prefer for the investigation to be completed first. Our clients’ decision not to make statements at this stage is based on their Constitutional rights and on legal advice. It does not imply that they are uncooperative in the matter.” Myburg, who is the author of The Republic of Gupta, added that while authorities may be targeting him for what he wrote with regards to the Gupta family and Zuma, they display very little interest in investigating his content. NB Publishers said it was concerned about the lack of transparency on the authorities’ behalf, while South African National Editors’ Forum (Sanef) perceived the actions of the police as intimidation tactics. However, police denied that Pauw and Myburgh were under investigation, saying that no case had been opened. – Caxton News Service  Read original story on citizen.co.za
