Police Minister Fikile Mbalula has slammed reports alleging that a manufacturer of sports clothing paid at least R300 000, possibly as much as R680 000, towards a holiday he and his family had recently enjoyed in Dubai. Speaking on the Karima Brown Show on Talk Radio 702 on Monday night, Mbalula described the allegations, that Sedgars Sport paid for the trip when he was the sports minister between late December 2016 and January this year, as malicious and a smear campaign against him. Sedgars Sport is a supplier of sports clothing to the South African Sports Confederation and Olympic Committee (Sascoc), and the issues has raised questions about a possible conflict of interest. Mbalula insisted he paid for the trip out of his own pocket, and said he was consulting his lawyers before formally responding to the allegations. “I did not ask the department of sport to pay for my [Dubai] trip. I paid for my own trip … I dispute what you have put before me,” a clearly irate Mbalula said. “For all those who have basically alleged whatever they have alleged or stated as facts, I’m consulting with my legal people.” Despite denying any wrongdoing, Mbalula said he was also ready to answer to parliament as a public representative. “If there’s anything that I need to declare, you don’t need to remind me and if I have erred in terms of ethics of parliament, let me be taken to task,” he said.
