The DA-led administration of the Tshwane municipality has welcomed the council s resolution that passed a report today for a 0% salary increase for the executive mayor, the speaker, the chief whip and all members of the mayoral committee, reports The Citizen.This means Executive Mayor Solly Msimanga, Chief Whip Christo van den Heever and Speaker Katlego Mathebe will not earn an extra cent extra on their salaries.Mayoral spokesperson Sam Mgobozi said this was accordance with the administration s commitment to act prudently with the city s money and, in so doing, not use these positions for individual self-enrichment but rather that all monies in the city s coffers be geared towards ensuring that services are provided to the people which we serve and the true VIPs of our city, the residents of Tshwane . This is also against the backdrop of a city administration which inherited a shambles of a financial situation which obviated the need to save money wherever we could and use the little money we did have intelligently and to the sole benefit of the people who elected us to serve them by providing basic services, said Mgobozi.
