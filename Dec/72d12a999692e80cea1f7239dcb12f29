Local business owner Zayne Bartley held a metallic made sign of Zuma s face that read #Tsotsi, reports The Citizen. We are getting taken for a ride many people are being raped by the governing body. It s their arrogance. Dalton Rosenburg, whose mother was an apartheid activist and who was born in California, America, before returning in 1994, said it was cut and dry that Zuma had failed.The reshuffle was not complicated . It s a clear and present danger for all South Africans. The student process a while ago did not appeal to all South Africans, but this particular protest should. Because it s a clear issue, and we should all be standing together on this. We are already on fragile ground in terms of our economy, said Rosenburg.Ever-vocal activist and opponent of Zuma and the ANC-led government Zachie Achmat said president had proven he could not lead the country. We are tired of hunger, inequality, joblessness and racial division; all now caused by the state collapsing and corporate lawlessness Jacob Zuma cannot lead the country; the ANC in its current form cannot lead the country. The real reason he got rid of Pravin Gordhan as an honest human person is simply because the Russians want the nuclear deal, Achmat said.
