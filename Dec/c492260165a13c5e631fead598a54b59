Dam levels continue to decline in Cape Town, with storage levels having decreased by 1.1% since last Monday, and consumption levels are 42 million litres above the City of Cape Town s collective usage target per day.The City of Cape Town Media Office on Monday issued a statement in which it said that dam storage levels had declined to 25.2%, but with the last 10% of dam water unusable, the dam levels were at 15.2%.Last week when the levels had declined to 16.2%, the City had said that at current consumption levels, there were only about 100 days of usable water left.Dam levels are at 15,2% of usable water! Reduce your personal use to about 100 litres a day.https://t.co/lmhYmEaIgf#ThinkWaterCT pic.twitter.com/iN9i5UgdkU&mdash; City of Cape Town (@CityofCT) April 11, 2017While the city was receiving a bit of rain , the City of Cape Town urged residents to continue to save water as consumption remained too high at 42 million litres above the collective usage target of 700 million litres a day.This means that despite the City s appeals last Monday for residents to reduce their water consumption, the levels remained relatively similar as the previous week at the end of March, as the City had said consumption had been at 741-million-litres a day.Cape Town remains on level 3B water restrictions. These were implemented on February 1.The City s mayoral committee member for informal settlements, water, waste services and energy councillor Xanthea Limberg warned: It will take a number of consecutive winters of good rainfall for our dam levels to recover and there is no guarantee that we will have above average rainfall in the coming winter. Limberg further stated that the best way to manage a drought was by increasing efforts to reduce water use. We have begun controlling the supply from our large Faure Reservoir by reducing pressure at the reservoir itself. If the pressure is lower, less water flows at a time. This is an innovative pilot project which has lowered pressure to the central and southern suburbs, said Limberg, adding that it was estimated that it was saving about 25-million litres of water per day. This work continues and consumers in the higher-lying central and southern suburb areas will also start to notice a drop in water pressure.
