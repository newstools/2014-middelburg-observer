Councillor Michael Sun, member of the mayoral committee (MMC) for public safety, has stated that by the time the JMPD closed the process on 4 May had received a staggering 65 000 applications, the Roodepoort Record reports.The Johannesburg Metropolitan Police Department (JMPD) recently advertised positions for 1 500 brave men and women to attend training and become protectors of the City of Johannesburg s (CoJ) residents. However, we never anticipated the great interest this position would garner, Sun said.This overwhelming response from the public indicates that the residents of CoJ are keen to join the JMPD and be part of the team of men and women who go beyond the call of duty to ensure our communities are safe. Although this is good news for JMPD and confirms we are on the right track, it is sadly also an indicator of the vast unemployment rate in our city, said Sun.He added that, with these new recruits, they would not only enhance the police force, but also create much-needed jobs.Applicants were assured that all applications would now be processed and successful applicants would be contacted to undergo a series of tests, including a fitness test to determine their physical and mental fitness before undergoing training.He concluded by saying, I believe these additional officers will contribute greatly to the city s efforts to combat crime, enforce by-laws and manage traffic congestion. I wish to thank all those who submitted their applications and wish them luck going forward. Caxton News ServiceRead original story on roodepoortrecord.co.za
