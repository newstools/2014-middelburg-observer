A video of popular prophet TB Joshua has begun going viral on social media since President Robert Mugabe was detained by military at his residence in Zimbabwe’s capital, Harare. Mugabe’s former vice-president Emmerson Mnangwagwa was ousted from his post last week. Joshua’s video, which is understood to have been taken in 2014, sees him prophesy about a military coup that will take place in an African country that is located in Southern Africa. “The military are interested in embarrassing a President – either they kill him or kidnap him. They are still having that plan to kidnap either a President or Vice-President of that nation or the First Lady of that nation,” said Joshua while speaking at his church, The Synagogue, Church Of All Nations (SCOAN) in Lagos, Nigeria. Joshua does not mention the name of the country, but says the objective of the military is also to kidnap the first lady of “that nation”. He adds the plan will succeed and throw that country into upheaval.  – Caxton News Service Read original story on citizen.co.za
