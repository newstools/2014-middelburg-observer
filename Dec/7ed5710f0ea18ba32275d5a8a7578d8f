Taking your eye off your child for one second while in a busy mall during the silly season could end up in disaster. This was the case for a Randburg couple, Hannah and Donovan Hughes, who allegedly had their child snatched away from them while browsing in the Adidas outlet store in Cresta Shopping Centre on 12 November. “Cresta was busy on Sunday so we thought we would browse inside a store which seemed more quiet,” Hannah said. “We were approached by a man and he started to chat with us telling us that he was from Bloemfontein. He kept mentioning how beautiful my son was and how he wished he could have a child like him of his own. We only turned away for a second when we heard our son scream.” The suspect allegedly grabbed the young boy and proceeded to run towards Dischem. “My husband Donovan chased after him and grabbed him by his neck… The man looked high as a kite. Thankfully, my child is okay, he was a bit traumatised at the time of the incident, but he is a strong boy.” After the man was detained by the centre’s security team he was released. No charges were pressed against the man as the incident could not be observed clearly due to low quality footage taken from the CCTV cameras . According to the security team, the man has been banned from the centre. “Crime picks up at this time and we can only encourage people to report crime to their nearest security guards when shopping here.” The incidence has not yet been reported to police.
