Following the brief relief from the torrential rainfall experienced over most parts of the country since the start of this week, the South African Weather Service has warned of more showers from on Thursday, going into the weekend.Provinces that have been receiving above normal rainfall this week include Gauteng, North West and KwaZulu Natal.Speaking to The Citizen on Wednesday, forecaster Bransby Bulo said although the rainfall amounts had somewhat decreased in Gauteng on Wednesday, residents should brace themselves for a 60% chance of showers and thunderstorms, mainly from Thursday afternoon. We expect the rain to continue on Thursday night into Friday morning. Going into the weekend, residents can expect a 30% chance of mainly isolated thunderstorms, Bulo said.He said temperatures would also start to gradually improve from the weekend, with maximums in Vereeniging, Johannesburg and Pretoria expected to range between 24 C and 27 C.In Limpopo, residents could expect a 60% chance of showers along the escarpment today, decreasing to 30% tomorrow and into the weekend.Similar conditions are expected in Mpumalanga.In North West on Thursday, most of the rainfall will be confined to the eastern parts of the province, which includes areas such as Sun City and Rustenburg.No rainfall was on the cards for most of the Free State, Bulo said, apart from the extreme eastern parts where only a 30% chance was predicted.Cloudy and wet conditions would persist over KwaZulu-Natal Thursday and Friday, continuing into the weekend.Only a 30% chance of rainfall was forecast for the Transkei area in the Eastern Cape Thursday and for the remainder of the weekend.The bad news, though, is that dry weather conditions will continue to grip the Western Cape, with only a slight chance of rain expected in George on Saturday.The Northern Cape was also expected to remain dry for the better part of the weekend.The level of the Vaal Dam, which towards the end of last year dropped alarmingly to about 25% of capacity, was 64.5% as of Wednesday.The Western Cape faces a serious drought and as a result, has tightened water restrictions from level 3 to level 3b in some municipalities.This means watering/irrigation (with municipal drinking water) of flower beds, lawns, vegetables and other plants, sports fields, parks and other open spaces is allowed only on Tuesdays and Saturdays before 9am or after 6pm for a maximum of one hour per day per property and only if using a bucket or watering can.No use of hosepipes or any sprinkler systems is allowed.
