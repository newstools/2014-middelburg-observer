Two 10 and 12-year-old boys are undergoing counselling after being held up in their bedroom during a house robbery early this morning in Salt Rock, KwaZulu-Natal, the North Coast Courier reports.The incident took place at around 3am this morning at a house in Marchant Crescent.Three men armed with knives gained access to the house through the children s bedroom after using a screwdriver to open a glass sliding door.The children s father, Glen Jamieson, said the two boys are going for trauma counselling. The boys had woken when they heard a noise from the glass door in their room. Three men had entered and pointed a knife at them. They were told to not scream or else they would hurt them. The men asked the boys for their phones and the children lied to them and said they did not own one. Jamieson said one of the robbers had kept watch outside, while the other stayed in the room, and the third man had gone into the dining room.Jamieson said his dogs, that were in his room upstairs, alerted him when they ran out the room. When I walked into the passage, one of the men had been running in my direction from the dining room. I pressed the panic button but all three men escaped through the glass door in the children s bedroom. Jamieson s property had been broken into twice this week. The first attempt was in my parent s cottage that is on my property. Two cellphones, one iPad and two laptops were stolen. We suspect the same men were involved. The children described the men as well spoken and oddly and were wearing reflective jackets. Caxton News ServiceRead original story on northcoastcourier.co.za
