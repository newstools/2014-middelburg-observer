Matthew said it was the biggest meteorite he had ever seen. It happened this morning when I turned from Golf Club Terrace into Constantia Drive, on the hill next to the Hyperama. It s the biggest and clearest meteorite I have ever seen, it was amazing. A meteorite is a solid piece of debris from an object, such as a comet, asteroid, or meteoroid, that originates in outer space and survives its passage through the Earth s atmosphere and impacts with the Earth s surface or that of another planet.When the object enters the atmosphere, various factors like friction, pressure, and chemical interactions with atmospheric gases cause it to heat up and radiate energy. It then becomes a meteor and forms a fireball, also known as a shooting or falling star. Caxton News ServiceRead original story on roodepoortrecord.co.za
