President Jacob Zuma failed to attend the launch of the 16 Days of Activism for No Violence against Women and Children in Eastern Cape. He was scheduled to be the keynote speaker at the event, which took place at the Nelson Mandela University’s Missionvale Campus on Saturday morning. Shortly after the launch started, the Presidency issued a statement saying Zuma would be represented by Minister of Women Susan Shabangu. There was no explanation provided with regards to the president’s absence. The theme for this year’s campaign is “Count me in: together moving a non-violent South Africa forward”, while the sub-theme is “OR Tambo and the emancipation of women.” 2017 marks 19 years since the 16 Days of Activism campaign launched in South Africa. The campaign aims to raise awareness about and prevent the ongoing issue of violence against women and children. Read original story on citizen.co.za
