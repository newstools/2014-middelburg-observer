DESPITE the valiant efforts of the brave and tireless fire and emergency crews, the #DurbanFire is still burning nearly 24 hours on.Rescue Care s Garrith Jamieson said this morning that the warehouse fire is the largest the fire fighters have ever attended.South Coast Road in the vicinity of the blaze remains closed, while Solomon Mahlangu Drive (Edwin Swales VC) and the M4 have reopened.The #DurbanFire has highlighted the need for a functioning evacuation plan, which the South Durban Community Environmental Alliance (SDCEA) has been calling for, for more than a decade. The fire is one of the biggest in the area in recent times, with smoke from the flames drifting as far as Ballito on the north coast and seen from Umbumbulu on the South Coast because of strong winds. It brought the M4 southern freeway to a standstill because of poor visibility and commuters who parked along the freeway to get a better look at the huge clouds of smoke and take photos, read a statement from the South Durban Community Environmental Alliance.SDCEA received reports from workers and other people in the area who said they had suffered burning eyes, nausea and coughing. They also confirmed that pollutants from the blaze and factory have spilled into the adjacent canal and made their way into the harbour. Once again residents are asking for the proposed emergency evacuation plan promised by the eThekwini Municipality for rollout during disasters such as today s fire.Can&#39;t go out until @TPT_Transnet come out and explain the health impact of this fire. I hope they have shut the beaches. #durbanfire pic.twitter.com/32zYXgUg7f&mdash; Fozia (@Rowiaza) March 25, 2017The uncontrolled smoke and fire, like other similar potential disasters in the South Durban Industrial Basin, pose a serious risk to the health of people in the area, and the environment. The lack of a publicised and accessible evacuation plan is therefore of great concern.There have been repeated calls for an evacuation plan, especially after previous incidents on the same scale.It again raises the question of why local government continues to allow the placement of dirty toxic industries among communities and along residential roads.So sad to wake up to smoke still twisting into the sky. This was taken around midnight. #durbanfire pic.twitter.com/W86jWN4fsp&mdash; Nicole Rimensberger (@hellotypewrite) March 25, 2017Read original story on southlandssun.co.za
