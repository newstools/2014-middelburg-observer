Following calls on social media for South Africans to take to the streets on Friday for a national shutdown to force President Jacob Zuma to step down, government has strongly warned that police will deal with illegal action, reports The Citizen.In a series of tweets on Monday evening, Government Communication and Information System (GCIS) said the call for citizens to occupy the streets and skip work in defiance to Zuma s reshuffled Cabinet could have unexpected consequences . Government assures all South Africans that Friday 7th April is a normal working day. We have noted social media messages which call for a shutdown of the country on Friday. The call made in these messages can have unexpected consequences, especially for our fragile economy business and communities. Whilst the public has a democratic right to embark on protest action government does not support acts of civil disobedience, GCIS said.Anti-Zuma protests have gained monument across the country with civil society organisations taking part in numerous demonstrations since last week s Cabinet reshuffle, which saw Pravin Gordhan and Mcebisi Jonas get fired as finance minister and deputy finance minister, respectively.The unprecedented move by Zuma has also been largely cited by Standard &amp; Poor on Monday to downgrade the country s economy to sub-investment grade or junk status.GCIS said protesters found guilty of any form of violence will face the might of the law. When citizens take to the streets illegally we often witness violence destruction of property and lawlessness. These illegal protests do not possess the characteristics of strengthening democracy GCIS said.CivilSociety organizations, business &amp; society at large are encouraged to work with Gov in strengthening our democracy to create a better SA&mdash; South African Gov (@GovernmentZA) April 3, 2017The social media messages are sent to disturb the economy and to create the impression of disorder and fear in communities.&mdash; South African Gov (@GovernmentZA) April 3, 2017The social media messages are sent to bring the image of SA into disrepute&mdash; South African Gov (@GovernmentZA) April 3, 2017Those found guilty of any form of violence will face the might of the law.&mdash; South African Gov (@GovernmentZA) April 3, 2017 Caxton News ServiceRead original story on citizen.co.za
