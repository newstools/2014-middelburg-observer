A storm alert has been issued by the provincial government, with disaster management teams placed on high alert as inclement weather is expected across KwaZulu-Natal this weekend. KZN MEC for Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs (Cogta) Nomusa Dube-Ncube has urged communities to exercise caution over the weekend as heavy rains coupled with hail and strong winds are expected to hit areas in the central and northern parts of the province (uMgungundlovu, uThukela, Amajuba, Umzinyathi and Zululand). The department has sensitised municipalities to oncoming risks and measures are in place to deal with any eventuality. “We urge residents not to take unnecessary risks like crossing rivers or swollen streams where water is above their ankles. Motorists are urged to drive slowly as roads are slippery and if they are trapped with their vehicle in rising water, they should abandon it and immediately seek higher ground,” continued Dube-Ncube. Residents are urged to follow news reports on radio and television for updates on the situation across the province. Read original story on southcoastsun.co.za
