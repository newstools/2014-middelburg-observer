An urgent application by a Centurion man who wanted the North Gauteng High Court in Pretoria to place him in control of Jehovah s Witnesses around the world has been struck off the roll.Ernest Ronald Gericke, an anointed one of the religious group, claimed in court papers he had been appointed in the office of the Christ and wanted the court to hear his public oath of office of the King .But Judge Bill Prinsloo struck the matter off the court roll.In what appeared to be papers drawn up by himself, Gericke sought an order placing him in full control and ownership over all the assets of Jehovah s Witnesses around the world, disbanding the governing body of the organisation and declaring him the rightful leader.He also wanted the court to interdict anyone who openly opposed the new arrangement and did not cooperate with him, and to order the police to assist him.In addition, he wanted the court to order that the organisation should immediately be providing him and his family with living and office space and cover their expenses.Gericke relied on quotes from the Bible and various publications of the organisation to sustain his claim to overall leadership and said as the new leader and the Christ , his order was that the South African branch of the organisation in Krugersdorp was declared as their new temporary headquarters; that the governing body was disbanded; memberships of committees revoked; and anyone who opposed him should be removed from the organisation s property.He said that after the court had heard his public oath of office, members of the organisation would then be presented, on April 11, with an oath to the king and would then become citizens of the Kingdom of God on Earth, which he would establish on that day. He wanted the court to order that this new arrangement be communicated to all congregations of the organisation around the world. Caxton News ServiceRead original story on citizen.co.za
