The Uber taxi movement has launched a new website to bring better understanding of Tshwane’s transportation needs, Centurion Rekord reports. It would make its own network data available to city leadership and urban planners in the city, said Uber head of public policy Yolisa Kani. She said the Uber Movement website would use only aggregate, anonymous data. Kania added that over time Uber would be adding more information, such as the location of potholes. The website would show data from the billions of trips of Uber clients, enriching information available to urban planners. “This will enable them to more effectively evaluate where investments in transportation infrastructure should be made in their cities.” Kani said: “Uber and the Council for Scientific And Industrial Research (CSIR) had signed an agreement to share information.”Senior CSIR official Mathetha Mokonyama said: “Transport planning is a data-intensive undertaking, and the required data sets tend to be expensive to collect and process. “Having a platform that serves as a full-day transport network sensor would certainly help with the monitoring of some of the pertinent network indicators.” DA councillor Elmarie Linde said Uber had set itself apart by coming up with the website. “The city is engaging with Uber to finalise the issuing of operating licences to its drivers and ensuring a greater transportation system.” – Caxton News Service Read original story on rekordcenturion.co.za
