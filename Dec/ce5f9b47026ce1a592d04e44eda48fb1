The DA has made a request to National Assembly speaker Baleka Mbete for an urgent question on allegations that President Jacob Zuma earned a salary from a private security company to be included in his oral reply to MPs questions today. This after veteran journalist and author Jacques Pauw in his new book, The President’s Keepers – Those keeping Zuma in Power and out of Prison, alleged that Zuma earned R1 million a month from Royal Security – a company owned by Durban businessman and well-known ANC supporter Roy Moodley – after he was inaugurated as the country’s president for at least four months. DA leader Mmusi Maimane wrote to Mbete on Wednesday, saying the allegations against Zuma could not go untested, and unless he could produce a compelling answer, his suitability as the country’s first citizen would be tarnished. “This week’s questions to the president will be the last opportunity to put this question to him in the House for several months. The earliest possible time after this will only be in March next year. South Africans cannot wait till then on a matter of such importance,” Maimane stated in his letter. The speaker’s office has approved the DA’s request.  For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter. Read original story on citizen.co.za
