 I don t think he expected me to chase him down, said Cathleen Bezuidenhout, referring to the ladder thief she caught, Kempton Express reports.And yes, it is highly unlikely the young man caught stealing from a home on Highveld Road thought the 30-year-old mother of three would manage to outrun him either.But Bezuidenhout, a wellness coach and co-runs a boot camp, did just that.The fitness guru managed to chase down a thief who had just stolen from a house opposite her husband s company, Bezuidenhout Attorneys, on Highveld Road. I was sitting inside the office working at about 12.30pm when my dad, who was outside, saw the thief jump over the fence into the yard of the house, Bezuidenhout explains.Cobus Uys, 57, alerted his daughter, who quickly reacted by running outside. By the time she got there, the thief was jumping out of the premises, carrying a bag and a stepladder.Uys shouted at the thief, who started making a run for it upon realising he had been caught in the act. Without thinking twice, the brave former neighbourhood watch member immediately ran after the suspect.She chased him down Highveld Road and finally cornered him on Kweper Street. Luckily on Wednesdays, I wear my gym clothes, so I think that also helped, she jokedIt does seem like a case of theft has been opened yet.
