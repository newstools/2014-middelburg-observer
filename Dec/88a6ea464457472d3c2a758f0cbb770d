A  vegetable farmer‚ Bokkie Potgieter was found dead in his bakkie near his Gluckstadt farm in KwaZulu-Natal on Monday. Potgieter, believed to be in his 70’s, was a private man who lived alone. At 10am this morning, a man entered  his home and attempted to steal his bakkie. A struggle ensued and the robber hacked Mr Potgieter on the face and head with a panga. The man then loaded the elderly man’s body into the bakkie and attempted to drive away. However the alleged killer crashed the bakkie into a pole a few metres from the small holding, drawing the attention of nearby farm workers. When they noticed Potgieter’s feet hanging out of the window, they approached the vehicle to investigate.     Read original story on vryheidherald.co.za
