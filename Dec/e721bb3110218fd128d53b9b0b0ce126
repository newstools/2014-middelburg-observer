A WEEK long search for Durban North resident, Siam Lee, has ended in tragedy. The 20-year-old’s burnt body was allegedly discovered near a farm in New Hanover in the KZN Midlands over the weekend. Lee had been missing since 4 January and was last seen leaving her workplace at about 3pm on Margaret Maytom last Thursday. A frantic search by family members, residents, the CPF, police and various roleplayers was launched following the young woman’s disappearance. An identikit of the man police believe could help with information on Lee was also released earlier this week. Marshall Security, Mobi Claw and a close family friend have put up social media statuses saying the body discovered in New Hanover was that of Siam Lee. “Its been a very long and hard week for us. We have worked literally non-stop behind the scenes with various role players and are all devastated by the outcome. We hope that having found Siam will bring some form of closure to her loved ones and we will continue to support the SAPS with ongoing investigations into this case,” said Kyle van Reenen of Marshall Security. Mobi Claw also released a statement saying they could confirm the body was Siam Lee.  While several sources have confirmed the tragic news, police would not comment. According to Capt Raymond Deokaran, spokesman for the Durban North SAPS, the body was discovered by a farmer on Saturday. “At this stage we can confirm a body was discovered in New Hanover but until such a time as DNA comes back to prove the body is that of Siam Lee we cannot say that is. Our investigations are ongoing at this point,” he said. Lt Col Thulani Zwane concurred with Deokaran. Northglen News has been unable to speak to Lee’s family who are yet to make a statement.
