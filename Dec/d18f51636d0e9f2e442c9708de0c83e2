Seine netters scooped about 150 crates of sardines at Umnini Beach near Umgababa on Tuesday morning and many shoals of the little silver fish were also spotted around Umkomaas on Tuesday, reports the South Coast Herald.However, Mike Anderson-Reade, KwaZulu-Natal Sharks Board s head of operations, said the sardine situation on the Lower South Coast, which had caused great excitement on Monday, had calmed down on Tuesday and no further nettings had taken place.Shark safety gear, which was removed at all beaches between and including Hibberdene and Port Edward on Monday in the wake of the arrival of the shoals, had not been replaced. The sharks board was monitoring the situation and would reinstate the gear at the busier beaches as soon as it was feasible, he said. Caxton News ServiceRead original story on southcoastherald.co.za
