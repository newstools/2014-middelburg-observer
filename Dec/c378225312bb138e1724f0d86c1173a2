The Democratic Alliance s leader, Mmusi Maimane, is one of the guests representing the political party at the It s Time prayer gathering on the Wilde Als farm just outside Bloemfontein, reports the Bloemfontein Courant.The Free State DA leader, Patricia Kopane, says Maimane was invited by the organisers and is officially representing the party at Angus Buchan s mass prayer session believed to be the biggest prayer gathering that South Africa has ever seen.Kopane says the party is attending the gathering at the Wilde Als farm outside Bloemfontein together with the rest of the country. She says the prayer session has a great significance in improving the morale of the nation. He is there to represent the Democratic Alliance. So it has a significant impact in the sense that although we are facing a crisis we have all decided to put our differences aside and come together to be united. Because when we are united that is when we become strong. Kopane says it should be acknowledged that although they represent a political party they are also human beings in need of spiritual healing and guidance. She says they appreciate the invite for the party to join the masses as they pray for the unsafe situation in the country. Caxton News ServiceRead original story on www.bloemfonteincourant.co.za
