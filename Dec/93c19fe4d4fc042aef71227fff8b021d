This comes after multiple complaints about bribery and corruption in the league all over the country. Earlier this year, Gauteng third division side Maccabi FC was accused of match-fixing. However, the club won the case after Safa DC ruled in their favour. There have also been complaints about match officials in North West and Limpopo. “We have purchased high definition video cameras for the second half of the season for each one of the team’s in the ABC Motsepe league, we are going to give to them and they will be required to record their own matches. So that it serves as a deterrent for those who are trying to do something whether it is match officials, club officials or anyone else for that matter,” said Safa CEO Dennis Mumble earlier this week. “We will call for those videos when we sit down for reviews and each club will be responsible. So we will have two videos for every match we play in this league. We will probably have to do that for other leagues when we get the money for it. “But there are continuing efforts for us to reduce the amount of misbehaviour in the lower leagues.” Read original story on citizen.co.za
