The Nelson Mandela Foundation today welcomed deputy secretary-general of the United Nations (UN) Amina J Mohammed to the country. Mohammed is due to deliver the 15th Nelson Mandela annual lecture in Cape Town on 25 November, 2017. “It’s great to be in South Africa,” Mohammed said, and indicated she was deeply honoured to have received the invitation, and felt “special” for being chosen to deliver the lecture during the UN International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women. Speaking about the theme of this year’s lecture, ‘Centering Gender: Reducing Inequality through Inclusion’, Mohammed urged: “We have to keep fighting the good fight.” Mohammed argued there could be no blueprint strategy on combating gender-based violence. “Every community, every society, needs to look inwards,” and include young people in all efforts, as ” hey are accelerators for change”. The next day, Sunday, Mohammed will pay an outreach visit to the nearby township of Khayelitsha. – Caxton News Service Read original story on citizen.co.za
