Emergency services and rescue teams had to rush to the aid of an injured hiker from a mountain in the west of Pretoria. On Saturday, Best Care ambulance services responded to a distress call at Magalies Mountain Lodge. “A hiker had been injured, he possibly fractured his ankle,” said Best Care spokesperson Xander Loubser. “With the help of Tshwane emergency services, a rescue team was sent up the mountain to aid the injured man.” Loubser said after stabilising the hiker and loading him onto a stretcher, the emergency services team made the slow trip back down after a 20 minute climb. “The patient will be transported to hospital for further medical care.”  Read original story on rekordmoot.co.za
