A flight from Plettenberg Bay to Cape Town had a very unlikely passenger – an endangered turtle that was saved from the brink of death, Knysna Plett Herald reports. Marketing manager at Tenikwa Wildlife Rehabilitation and Awareness Centre in Plett Amelia Havemann said vigilant members of the Sedgefield Animal Matters group discovered a juvenile green sea turtle washed up on the beach in Sedgefield. “The turtle was on its back, and they at first believed it was dead. When they flipped the turtle over, they realised it wasn’t and brought it to Tenikwa,” Havemann said. The turtle was dehydrated and suffered from a large wound to one of its flippers. The turtle “We were, however, able to stabilise the turtle and managed to rehydrated it. We nursed him back to such a condition where a flight to the Two Oceans Aquarium in Cape Town, for further care, would be possible.” CemAir agreed to sponsor the turtle’s flight to Cape Town, and the young marine creature boarded the flight.
