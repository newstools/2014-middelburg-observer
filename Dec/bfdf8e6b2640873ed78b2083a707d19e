The state will ask the Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA) today in Bloemfontein to lengthen the jail term of former Paralympian Oscar Pistorius. The national prosecuting authority appealed Judge Thokozile Masipa’s six-year sentence against Pistorius for the murder of Reeva Steenkamp. The state argued after sentencing was handed out that the sentence was lenient and did not reflect the seriousness of the crime. According to library of congress on sentencing guidelines of SA, the presiding judge has the discretion to impose whatever sentence fit for the crime, but should reflect the seriousness of the crime, the circumstance of the offender and the interests of society. “Penalty varies depending on whether it is the offender’s first, second, third, or subsequent offence.” “First-time offence is subject to at least 15 years’ imprisonment,” library of congress said. Pistorius was arrested on Valentine’s day in 2013, for shooting and killing his girlfriend. He was initially convicted of culpable homicide, which was later overturned by the SCA to murder, to which he was sentenced to six years. Advocate Andrea Johnston will lead the state’s case after prosecutor Gerrie Nel resigned from the NPA earlier this year to join Afri-Forum. Read original story on rekordeast.co.za
