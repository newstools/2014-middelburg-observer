It was an amazing little event. I m so proud of this achievement, said Yudelowitz.As a avid walker, he participates in the Walk/Run For Life programme in Sandringham, and aims to walk at least 24km per week. There s a group of us who walk together along six different routes. It s such a calming activity to do with your friends. I think that walking is such an amazing thing to do. Besides being healthy, it is nice to be out in the neighbourhood and socialising. I recommend it to everyone. Caxton News ServiceRead original story on northeasterntribune.co.za
