Video footage has emerged showing an elephant chasing tourists safari vehicle in the Kruger National Park, Mpumalanga. Our group, Tradughters Abbie and Katie Mansfield, along with their boyfriends, Ben Wild and Ian Pots, and myself were driven by Sefapane game ranger Elias Shai [who also freelances for Kruger Park in the winter] when incident occurred, said one of the tourists, Lowvelder reported. We had spent the whole day travelling through the park particularly looking for lions, which was challenging due to the recent rain and long grass. We where all nodding off as we had been on the road since 5am, and this happened at about 4.30pm. This encounter sure did wake us up and made for an incredible experience. This happened while driving south about 25 minute drive from Phalaborwa gate, said the tourist. Caxton News ServiceRead original story on lowvelder.co.za
