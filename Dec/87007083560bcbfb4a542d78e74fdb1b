ANC secretary-general Gwede Mantashe is expected to address the Gauteng provincial policy conference in Irene, east of Pretoria, this evening, reports The Citizen.ANC national spokesperson Zizi Kodwa said the provincial policy conference was expected to consolidate the provincial policy perspectives leading to the fifth national policy conference, to be held from June 30 until July 5.Some regions in the province seem to agree on the proposed two deputy president portfolios for the ANC, with one being a woman.The suggestion first emerged from the Northern Cape ANC, which further proposed three deputy secretaries-general one for campaigns and membership, another for cadre development and political education and the third for battle of ideas.The Northern Cape was proposing a top nine instead of the current top six officials and that one of two proposed deputy presidents should focus on national planning, monitoring and evaluation and another on international relations.This week, Gauteng regions held their regional general councils and policy conferences.All but one region, Ekurhuleni, led by Mzwandile Masina, indicated their preference for Cyril Ramaphosa to succeed Jacob Zuma as ANC president.Last week, ANC provincial chairperson Paul Mashatile indirectly indicated that Ramaphosa would be the province s choice.The province believed this approach should be followed as it helped to avoid divisions.However, the Zuma camp favours Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma.With Gauteng, Limpopo, the Northern Cape and Western Cape on his side and huge support in the Eastern Cape, things are beginning to gel for the Ramaphosa campaign.Dlamini-Zuma, on the other hand, enjoys solid support in the Free State, Mpumalanga, North West and KwaZulu-Natal.
