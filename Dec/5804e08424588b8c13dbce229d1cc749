Beachgoers and holidaymakers trying to take advantage of the sunny weather today (Friday) are in for a bit of disappointment, the North Coast Courier reported.All of KwaDukuza s beaches have been closed to bathers because of a huge swell causing massive waves.KDM lifeguard supervisor Bongani Xulu told The Courier that they had been forced to close the beaches for safety sake. At first we closed all the southern beaches from Tinley Manor all the way down to Clarke Bay but after looking at the conditions the decision was made to close the northern ones too. Xulu said they would reassess the situation tomorrow to see if the beaches would be reopened. Tomorrow morning they will still be closed. After we have assessed the conditions, we will make a decision whether to open them in the afternoon. He urged beachgoers to always pay attention to the instructions of lifeguards and never take the threat of the ocean for granted. Caxton News ServiceRead original story on northcoastcourier.co.za
