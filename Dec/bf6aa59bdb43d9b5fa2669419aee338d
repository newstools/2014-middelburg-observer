We are responsible for the growth and well-being of our local economies and our residents. She added they needed to build more resilient cities by factoring their response to climate change in all the work they do, and she highlighted the initiatives in the City since she last addressed the Climate Change Coalition.One of these initiatives is a draft Climate Change Policy, which she said was a new approach for the city as climate change had previously been addressed within the City s environmental policy, and it was hoped it would be formally adopted by Council soon.De Lille further mentioned that Cape Town was a member of a network of over 90 cities that worked to reduce carbon emissions, the C40 Climate Leadership Group; the City was committed to reducing carbon emissions and diversifying the energy supply as part of it s Energy2040 Goal; and, that there was an aim to source 20% of the city s energy from renewable sources by 2020.Patricia de Lille posted this photo from the Cape Town Climate Change Coalition meeting on her public Facebook page.
