Social media users are calling for the closure of a Facebook group after it made a mockery of a professional hunter who was killed when an elephant fell on him, reports the Centurion Rekord.The group, Deepadale-Game Farm, shared a post of Theunis Botha, 51, lying dead underneath the elephant.The picture was originally posted by a woman from Oxford, in the United Kingdom.She said: So it is okay to post pictures of hunters with their kill. But it is apparently not okay to post pictures of hunters that get killed themselves when their kill falls on them while getting killed, killing them? Yeah. Okay. Nope, NOT sorry. People condemned the post, saying the Facebook user should be jailed.Another Facebook user accused the group of being heartless, saying Botha had five children. People who can t tolerate legal hunting. Legal within the law and think it s okay to disrespect humanity and to gloat over the death of a family man with 5 kids. I m sickened saddened and totally shocked, one user said.By the time of going to print, the group could not be reached for comment.According to media reports, Botha died on Friday afternoon during a hunt in Gwai, Zimbabwe, when a member of his group fired at a storming elephant cow and the animal fell on him.He lived in Tzaneen.Media reports said Botha was leading a group of hunters when four elephants charged the group inside the Good Luck Farm preserve in Zimbabwe.A female elephant lifted Botha with her trunk before another hunter shot her.
