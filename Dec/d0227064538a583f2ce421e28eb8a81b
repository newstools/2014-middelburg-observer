A 21-year-old woman in Brakpan, east of Johannesburg, was held captive for almost two days by kidnappers who demanded money from her boyfriend, Brakpan Herald reports. The woman was abducted by the occupants of a taxi, and the incident has sparked concern among local police who have issued a warning to female taxi commuters to be vigilant. Captain Pearl van Staad, spokesperson for Brakpan police, told the Herald the woman boarded a white Toyota Quantum to Daveyton in the Brakpan CBD on Saturday afternoon. Van Staad explained there were six men in the taxi, including the driver, and four other women. “They were travelling towards Springs when the men blindfolded all the women and bound their hands with cable ties,” she said. “The victims were taken to an informal settlement where they were locked in a shack with a man who watched over them at gunpoint. “The man would then make contact with the victims’ family or friends and demand money.” According to Vvan Staad, one of the victims was released on Saturday evening after R1 000 was paid to the kidnappers. The Brakpan victim was released on Monday after her boyfriend paid the ransom via a money transfer service at a retail store. Her boyfriend, who lives in Alexandra, Johannesburg, also reported the kidnapping to his local police station, and the case has since been transferred to the Brakpan SAPS where it is under investigation. Van Staad commented that the victim, who is a student currently writing exams, is extremely traumatised. “We are appealling to women not to catch taxis in town, but to rather go to the taxi rank where it is safer,” she said. “If you do fall victim to criminals in a taxi, stay alert and try and memorise the taxi’s registration number.” Read original story on
