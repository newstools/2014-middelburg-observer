Paramedics have found a pulse on the suspect who was initially thought to have been shot dead during the shooting incident at Kyalami Corner, north of Johannesburg, Fourways Review reports. A police officer on the scene further explained there were four suspects involved in the incident, and two of them fled the scene. One suspect was arrested at the centre, another was shot in the neck and initially presumed to be dead, but paramedics found a pulse. A police officer was also shot in the hand. Ria Sebetsa Security Services on scene. Danny Maduray of Rea Sebetsa Security Services explained the incident first unfolded in Wynberg when the suspects hijacked a white VW Polo that was later recovered. Details are unclear at present, but it seems the suspects hijacked another vehicle and ended up at Kyalami Corner shopping centre. It is unclear what the suspects’ intentions at the shopping centre were.  A police helicopter landed in the car park, and more shots were fired. Police locked patrons inside the Woolworths store as they secured the scene. The patrons were, however, contained in the parking lot, and were prevented from leaving the shopping centre’s premises and from entering the centre as the police secured the scene. Police apprehend one of the suspects. – Caxton News Service     Read original story on fourwaysreview.co.za
