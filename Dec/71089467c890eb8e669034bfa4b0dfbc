City of Tshwane bus drivers have been relieved from handling cash to concentrating only on getting their commuters safely to their destinations, reports The Citizen.Tshwane mayor Solly Msimanga on Monday launched the new cashless system for the Tshwane Bus Service (TBS).Speaking at the Church Square bus depot, Msimanga said the new automated fare collection (AFC) system was cashless and would assist in ensuring proper financial accounting processes for the city. This is a quantum leap for TBS, as the paper-based ticket system used in the past was riddled with problems that, at times, led to unnecessary bus stoppages that were a nuisance to the city and passengers. In addition, the integrated fare collection system will enhance the travelling experience of the passengers and make life easier, Msimanga said.According to the mayor, this was also in an effort to remove the responsibility of handling cash from bus drivers. All 227 professional bus drivers were trained to be able to understand and make use of the connector card, as well as on the board validator, fitted to the city s buses, Msimanga said. The current fare payment method of coupons and paper tickets will be phased out and no longer be permitted for use on TBS buses. Customers using the buses have two months to migrate to the new connector, as the previous system expires on May 17.The new payment method is also used by the city s Tshwane rapid transit system, A Re Yeng, and provides for an integrated travel card that can be used on both systems.The connector card can be bought and loaded at Sammy Marks Customer Care, Church Square and any A Re Yeng station.The card costs R25, equal to 25 ridership points if you are a registered passenger.Msimanga said customers could also load it at any Absa ATM that had a cash-accepting facility and could be used for other purposes like retail transactions, as it s European MasterCard- and Visa-compliant.It takes less than 10 minutes to buy and register a card. Passengers are encouraged to register their cards. Today, as we launch, we can report that more than 90% of the system in the buses is responding 100%. By tomorrow, all systems in the buses should be 100% functional, which will be a record for all our predecessors in this regards. Caxton News ServiceRead original story on citizen.co.za
