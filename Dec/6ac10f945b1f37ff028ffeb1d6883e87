After three months of scrutiny into the SABC s affairs, parliament s ad hoc committee adopted its final report on Friday with unanimous agreement that Communications Minister Faith Muthambi be hauled over the coals, reports The Citizen.Committee members decided that Muthambi s fate lay with the ethics committee and President Jacob Zuma.Although the DA agreed it wanted further action, it wanted one addition that Muthambi also be reported to the public protector for investigation.The committee s bone of contention was a 2014 memorandum of incorporation (MOI).The MOI gave powers to the minister and SABC executive Hlaudi Motsoeneng to override decisions of the board.However, it seems the MOI was not legally binding as the particularly amended MOI wasn t filed with the Companies and Intellectual Property Commission. If this was the case, it meant the minster and SABC couldn t sign off on removals and appointments of board members.Motsoeneng, despite lacking qualifications and quickly rising to a power position, was one such appointment.Chairperson Vincent Smith said he thought the public and the critics would be fairly satisfied with the recommendations that were adopted and implemented. The goal of getting the SABC from a position where it was when we started, to a better place, is guaranteed, he said.This week, the MOI and the role of the department of communications were the main sticking points.The collapse and now formal dissolution of the SABC board, censorship and employee revolt meant someone had to stand up and face the consequences. What would have been the steps taken in the instance where the minster, both current or past minister (Yunus Carrim) might have been complicit in their by omission or commission in where the SABC is now, said Smith. We agree that there were missteps for want of a better word. There s no dispute that there is a need for action. Some of the recommendations included that an independent company conduct a forensic investigation into irregular appointments, salary increases and questionable contracts awarded.Editorial policy had to be tossed. Public input was needed and journalists had to be allowed to work without fear and intimidation. In addition, the acting positions of the chief executive office, financial officer and operating boss had to be filled by qualified and worthy people.
