While there have been no major incidents caused by the inclement weather conditions experienced over most parts of the country, the Johannesburg emergency services have expressed concern regarding the forecast of more rainfall.Speaking to The Citizen, spokesperson for the emergency services, Robert Mulaudzi, said a number of flooding reports were received overnight on Tuesday in Orange Farm and Finetown, south of Johannesburg. Nine houses were affected in Orange Farm and two shacks were flooded, leaving 36 people affected. In Finetown, our emergency personnel could not complete their assessment work due to safety reasons, Mulaudzi said.In Diepsloot extension 7, 30 dwellings were affected by the heavy downpours.No injuries were reported.In Stjwetla, Alexandra, several residents were rescued and evacuated near the Jukskei River, where water levels rose by 70%.With more rainfall forecast for the remainder of this week, Mulaudzi said they were worried about the possible damage more wet weather could have, considering the fact that the ground was still wet from the heavy downpours experienced this week. However, with a joint operational disaster management team consisting of various departments in the City of Johannesburg, we will remain on standby in case more flooding occurs. Our message to residents, especially those in informal settlements, is for them to remain on high alert. Motorists must also exercise extra caution and avoid flooded roads at all costs, Mulaudzi said.Some of the roads which are flood-prone include Witkoppen in Sunninghill, Vincent Tshabalala in Alexandra, New Canada road near Noordgesig, Klip Valley Road and Smit Street in Braamfontein and Johannesburg.Several roads were still flooded from Tuesday s downpours, with several accidents also having been reported.
