A housesitter was tied up for almost two hours after he was confronted by four men, one of whom was armed in the early hours of Friday morning in uMhlanga, Northglen News reports. The incident occurred at 1am on Ridge Road, confirmed Captain Raymond Deokaran, spokesperson for the Durban North police. “The suspects surprised the man before tying him up. They spent almost two hours in the home stealing various items including the homeowner’s Black VW Amarok. A case of house robbery has been opened by Durban North police,” Deokaran said. In a separate incident, in Durban North, a number of suspects forced open a side window of an Oxford Drive home in a break-in just a half hour later on the same morning. The suspects ransacked the home and also stole the homeowner’s vehicle, a Renault Megan. It’s unclear if the gang involved in both robberies were connected. The incident follows an armed robbery of a La Lucia couple on Homeford Drive just after lunchtime on Tuesday. In the incident, one of the suspects stood guard outside the property with an assault rifle while his accomplices, armed with handguns, ransacked the home. – Caxton News Service Read original story on northglennews.co.za
