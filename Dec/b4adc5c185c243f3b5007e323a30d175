Musician Vusi Nongxo, popularly known as Vusi Nova, has opened up about the hijacking ordeal he went through last week. Vusi said he was driving home from Ntando s album launch, along with 047, a new group from Mthatha, when it happened.When they arrived at his place in Melville, a car pulled up behind them and three armed men jumped out and told the group to get out of the car. Another person grabbed and pulled me into the car as well. We were told to look down at the floor while they held guns to our heads, Vusi Nova was quoted as saying by the Sunday Sun.He said the hijackers fired a shot during the attack. They then took over and drove the car, with a gun still against Vusi Nova s head. The hijackers then stopped about five minutes later and told one of the 047 members to take all his clothes off and left him there. At that point, he did not know where they were. They were screaming at me to show them where the tracker was. They also had my wallet and bank cards out, asking for pins. The one guy kept repeating: We re going to kill you, take you to the bush and cut off your nipples and penis, he was quoted as saying.After threats of murder and mutilation, the thugs stopped at a garage and withdrew money from his cards and later told him to take off his clothes too. They dropped him there and drove off, and Vusi Nova did not know where he was, until he asked a woman who told him he was in Chiawelo, Soweto. People are being hijacked every day, and not given a platform to tell their story. Thank God, it just wasn t my time. Crime is out of hand, he said.His Range Rover, however, is allegedly still in the hands of his assailants.For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and TwitterRead original story on
