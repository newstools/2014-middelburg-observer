Tshwane residents are encouraged to take a closer look at their municipal accounts to make sure their property valuation is correct, as this determines their property tax, reports The Citizen.Civil rights organisation AfriForum said the Tshwane Metropolitan Municipality had just published its property valuation roll which will be valid for the next four years.Lambert de Klerk, AfriForum s district coordinator for Gauteng North, said they want to emphasise that this presents home owners with the opportunity to check their property s valuation and ensure that the municipality assesses them at the correct tariff. This is an opportunity for community members to ensure that their property valuation is calculated correctly as this valuation, together with the applicable tariff, will determine their property tax. They should, therefore, make use of this opportunity, explained De Klerk.The valuation roll is available on Tshwane s website hereHome owners should search for their property details and ensure that the valuation of their property is correct. In case of a major inconsistency, they should appeal against the valuation by completing the forms on the same web page. Caxton News ServiceRead original story on citizen.co.za
