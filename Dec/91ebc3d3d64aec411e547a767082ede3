The women s race at next week s Comrades Marathon has been dealt a massive blow, with defending up run champion and local favourite Caroline Wostmann pulling out of the annual contest after failing to shake off a persistent hamstring injury, reports The Citizen.Wostmann, who secured her maiden Comrades victory in 2015 when she missed the up run record by less than four minutes to end a lengthy winning streak by foreign athletes, had withdrawn during last month s Two Oceans 56km race in Cape Town after picking up a niggle during the race. Even though everything in me wants to go and run Comrades, I have made the heartbreaking decision to listen to my medical team and withdraw from the race, Wostmann said in a statement on Monday.Though she had initially hoped to recover in time for the annual 87km road race in KwaZulu-Natal, Wostmann said the diagnosis was worse than her medical team had initially presumed. Despite aggressive treatments and rehab to the injury, it hasn t healed sufficiently to allow me to safely compete at Comrades, she said.In her absence, the women s race was expected to be a wide open battle featuring the likes of compatriot Charne Bosman, who chased down a cramping Wostmann to win last year s down run, and American contender Camille Herron.
