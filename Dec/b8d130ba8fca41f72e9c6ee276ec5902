The first deputy general secretary of the SACP, Solly Mapaila, has criticised President Jacob Zuma’s last speech as ANC leader on Saturday, saying it was pathetic and dishonest. This after Zuma slammed the ANC’s tripartite alliance partners, the SACP and Cosatu, during the delivery of his political report to the 54th ANC national conference in Nasrec, south of Johannesburg. Speaking on the sidelines of the congress, Mapaila accused Zuma of being economical with the truth, saying he failed to speak frankly about the challenges faced by the country and alliance. “He [Zuma] was extremely pathetic dealing with the issues of the alliance. He did not indicate what made us speak outside the alliance. That is why the reconfiguration of the alliance is important,” Mapaila said. He said Zuma condemned factionalism and corruption within the movement, but could not lead by example, saying the president had “presided over massive corruption of our state resources”. “There hasn’t been accountability and honesty and he has been at the helm of dishonesty himself‚” Mapaila added.
