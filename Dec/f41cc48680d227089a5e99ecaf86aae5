At a press conference in Pretoria on Thursday morning, Police Minister Fikile Mbalula announced that the deputy national head of the National Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation (the Hawks), Yolisa Matakata, had been appointed as the acting head of the Hawks, reports The Citizen.Mbalula explained that her appointment was a matter of following protocol after the courts barred the former head from holding the post.He said a permanent head of the Hawks would probably be appointed before the end of the year.Matakata told the media it was an honour and a privilege to accept the appointment, fulfil her mandate and serve the people of South Africa without fear or favour.She said she would adhere to the Hawks mandate despite any negative perceptions about the Hawks.Sunday Times reported that Matakata was formerly the head of the Hawks in the Western Cape and was previously in the limelight with news reports that a shady businessman had allegedly tried to bribe her unsuccessfully with R1 000 to stop an investigation into his activities .She worked in Crime Intelligence for 15 years and became the provincial head of the same division in the Western Cape in 2008.Berning Ntlemeza s appointment had been nullified by the high court in Pretoria the previous day.Mbalula also gave reasons for why he withdrew the appeal lodged at the Supreme Court of Appeal on the case brought by the Helen Suzman Foundation and Freedom Under Law (FUL) involving Ntlemeza.He said Ntlemeza would have to pay his own costs for his unsuccessful appeals, saying that as the new police minister he was determined to curb wasteful expenditure.On Wednesday the court ruled that its earlier finding that Ntlemeza was not a fit and proper person to lead the Hawks should come into immediate effect even though he has appealed the ruling.Mbalula, who was recently appointed police minister, on Wednesday also withdraw the appeal lodged at the Supreme Court of Appeal against the finding that Ntlemeza s appointment was irrational and unlawful .Ntlemeza was appointed permanently to the position by former police minister Nathi Nhleko in September 2015, despite Judge Elias Matojane having found that the general lacks integrity and honour and had lied under oath.Subsequently, FUL and the Helen Suzman Foundation brought arguments before court saying Ntlemeza was not fit and proper to hold office the court agreed with them.Last month the court ruled that Ntlemeza lacked the requisite honesty, integrity and conscientiousness to occupy any public office, and declared his appointment invalid and unlawful. The then police minister appealed the ruling.On Wednesday the court said its findings needed to be acted on immediately meaning Ntlemeza ceased to be head of the Hawks.
