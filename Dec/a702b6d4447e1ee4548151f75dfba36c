ANC MP Vytjie Mentor has taken to social media to share a story that has left her followers fearing for her life.In a Facebook post, Mentor said she was driving out of her garage on Wednesday when her Land Rover Evoque started jerking badly. As if that wasn t enough, later in the day, the gear refused to move from reverse to drive mode, only to then stop abruptly in the middle of the road with moving traffic.She said she quickly pressed the stop button and restarted it, but then it jumped forward at high speed. I could have smashed into the car in front of me! It was only grace that made sure that no one hits me from the back and that I don t crash at high speed into a vehicle in front of me. She gave up on the car and called a towing truck, as she did not want to put her life in danger. The car company then told her they found an unknown device in her car that could have led to her death. I get a message this morning that they found an unknown device plugged into my vehicle, and this device was the cause of the problem. I could have died two days ago! But God s grace is sufficient for me. The crooks won t go down without a fight. Please pray for me, she said.&nbsp;In October 2016, the Hawks intercepted communication material of possible planned assassinations targeting various members of Cabinet, state-owned entities and prominent South Africans.Mentor s name was earlier this year on the hit list targeting South African government leaders perceived as beneficiaries of state capture, including President Jacob Zuma and former public protector Thuli Madonsela.For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and TwitterRead original story on
