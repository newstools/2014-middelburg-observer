An intelligence-driven operation by the North West Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation led to the arrest of a man (29) and a woman (19) for allegedly dealing in Mandrax drugs at Leemhuis section in Klerksdorp, North West, Potchefstroom Herald reports. According to the North West Hawks spokesperson Captain Tlangelani Rikhotso, about 2090 Mandrax tablets valued to be worth R105 000 and a large amount of money were found at the couple’s rental apartment during the search. “The Hawks received information about the couple’s alleged drug dealing, and the information was subsequently followed up. Upon arrival at the couple’s apartment, the male suspect tried to delay opening the door, leading the Hawks members to break the door down. Upon gaining entry, it was discovered that the suspect was allegedly trying to flush the drugs.” Drugs in the toilet Rikhotso said: “It’s also alleged that he had already thrown other drugs through the window which were later found behind the apartment. Besides the drugs that the suspect tried to flush, there were more drugs found in a bag and inside the cupboard.” Money and drugs confiscated. Rikhotso added the bust comes shortly after the member behind the operation was hailed at the North West DPCI awards on Friday for his great work specifically involving drugs. At the awards ceremony, the provincial head of the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation in North West Major-General Linda Mbana encouraged the award recipients to continue working hard and those who didn’t get awards to shake up the dust. Mbana said: “The DPCI drug unit as well as the Priority Violent Crimes Unit has changed its strategy. The criminals must start panicking, as we are approaching festive season.” – Caxton News Service Read original story on potchefstroomherald.co.za
