Despite ANC stalwarts last-ditch attempt to pressure NEC members to finally take action against Zuma, this is unlikely to happen, and Zuma will emerge from the meeting unscathed, reports The Citizen.This is according to political analyst Professor Somadoda Fikeni, who was giving his views after Reverend Frank Chikane, a member of the stalwarts group and former director-general in the Presidency during Mbeki s term, said they were pleading with the majority of NEC members to push for Zuma to be recalled. I don t see that happening. The best they can hope for is for the meeting to discuss implementation of the recommendation made by former public protector Adv Thuli Madonsela in the State of Capture report issued in 2016. In December 2016, President Zuma approached the North Gauteng High Court in Pretoria for a judicial review of the remedial actions Mandonsela recommended in her report.Madonsela asked Zuma to appoint a commission of inquiry into state capture. She specified that the chairperson of such a commission be appointed by Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng.In his affidavit, Zuma sounds aggrieved with this particular recommendation, telling the court it is inconsistent with the constitution and breaches the separation-of-powers principle .Meanwhile, Tokyo Sexwale, another ANC stalwart and chairperson of Trillian Capital Partners, a Gupta-linked company implicated in multimillion-rand tenders awarded irregularly by Eskom, has distanced himself from the company.He told the media this morning that what the country was currently experiencing was not state capture, but a handover of the state to private individuals.
