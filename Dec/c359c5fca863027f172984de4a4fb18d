A gardener working in the back garden of a Riverside Road, Amanzimtoti home made the gruesome discovery of skeletal remains this afternoon (Monday, 13 November). Police were expected at the home, where the bones and skull of a person were uncovered at about 3 pm when the gardener was clearing bush at the back of the property. Paramedics who responded to the scene speculate that the remains may have rolled down an embankment from Dingwall Road, and been uncovered during the recent severe storms that struck Amanzimtoti in October. ER24 paramedic, Leo Fourie confirmed that the skeleton was that of a person, and that it was devoid of soft tissue. It is not known whether the skeleton was of a man or woman.
