The eThekwini Municipality has extended the period for the inspection and lodging of objections by property owners of the third General Valuation Roll from March 31 to May 2, 2017, reports the Northglen News.The municipality released its valuation roll in February, encouraging all property owners to inspect the roll and lodge an objection if necessary. The initial deadline for objections has now been extended to allow property owners more time to submit an objection should they wish.The valuation roll contains more than half-a-million property entries, the vast majority of which fall within the Residential Rating Category and a general valuation is required to be undertaken at least once every four years in terms of the Municipal Property Rates Act.Deputy city manager for the finance cluster Krish Kumar stressed the importance of inspecting the roll. Property owners are encouraged to inspect the roll to determine whether the entries reflected therein are a correct reflection of the property. The property owner may lodge an objection if he/she feels that the valuation is either too high or too low, said Kumar.The 2017 general valuation roll is available on www.durban.gov.za, at all Sizakala Centres and completed objection forms can be hand delivered on the ground floor at the Real Estate Unit which is situated at 75 Dr Langalibalele Dube (Winder) Street, Durban or emailed to val.roll@durban.gov.za.
