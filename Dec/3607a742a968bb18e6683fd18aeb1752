Former Zimbabwe president Robert Mugabe has done himself a financial favour by resigning, as an impeachment process would have seen him get fired with no benefits. The Presidential Pension and Retirement Act states: “Pensions payable to former presidents and surviving spouses, subject to this Act, there shall be paid— (a) to the first President of Zimbabwe an annual pension that is equal at any time to seventy-five per centum of the annual salary payable to the person who is serving as President; and to the any person who has at any time since the 31st December, 1987, been President or Vice President of Zimbabwe for at least one full term of office, an annual pension that is equal at any time to the annual salary payable to the person who is serving as President or Vice President, as the case may be that a former president can be denied pension if he or she leaves office having ‘acted in wilful violation of the Constitution; or of gross misconduct’.” In simple terms, Mugabe will earn the same salary earned by a sitting president. He claimed in an interview in 2015 that he was earning $12 000 (R167 064) a month. Sam Ncube‚ a lawyer based in Harare, told TimesLive that Mugabe would be “well off”, as the constitution was drafted with his exit in mind. Grace will also not struggle, as she will reportedly get state-sponsored domestic help, air travel, office accommodation and an entertainment allowance. In the event that Mugabe passes on, Grace will receive 60% of the pension. The 93-year-old former president resigned on Tuesday evening, in an announcement that saw Zimbabweans all over the world celebrating their “newfound freedom”. Some were, however, disappointed as Grace’s win at the December conference would have presented them with business opportunities. – Caxton News Service   Read original story on citizen.co.za
