Roseruthe said one of their members sustained injuries from the fights that broke out during the IDP meeting, but this would not make them retreat and stop their fight for service delivery.Shadow Member of Mayoral Committee for public safety, DA councillor Michael Sun said the meeting had kicked off smoothly until one unknown individual began to disrupt the proceedings and was quickly joined by about five men in confronting other residents. The Metro police tried to negotiate and calm the instigators but only to see them disrupt even more and ultimately a fight broke out between residents and the instigators and chairs and water bottles were thrown at individuals, said Sun.Sun furthermore said that Metro police officers and Midrand police were called for backup but once the disruptive crowd was thrown out they attempted to get back in and attacked police officers as well as threw stones at the hall building.Paramedics were called to the scene to assist the injured.Mashaba threatened to lay criminal charges against ANC councillors who are being blamed for the mayhem.He released a statement about the incident stating, Last night the ANC violently disrupted the Integrated Development Plan (IDP) summit I was hosting at Midrand High School. A number of individuals were injured following the violence, including an EFF member who had a gash to his head, as well as the chairperson of Ward 112, Andrew Osmond, who was hit with a brick on the back of his head with such force that he was concussed and had to be taken to hospital. Disgracefully, this attack on our democracy was led by ANC councillors in the City of Joburg. According to Mashaba, the City of Joburg is left with no option but to lay criminal charges against ANC councillors who were leading this assault on the democracy and fueling the violence. Charges will include damage to property and assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm. Ward 112 councillor, Madeleine Hicklin said, I am horrified by the thuggery that marked last night s IDP feedback meeting. A disruption of this nature is not only uncalled for but unacceptable, hence, I am pleased to see that the executive mayor is laying criminal charges against the councillors who were intimately involved in the attacks on innocent individuals who came to hear how the City was going to respond to their needs. The meeting proceeded after police restored the peace.
