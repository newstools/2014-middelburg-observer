POLOKWANE – Limpopo Provincial Government’s cumulative contingent liabilities – legal obligations – are currently more than R6,5 billion. The Office of the Premier, Stanley Mathabatha, on Friday appeared before the Standing Committee for Public Accounts (Scopa) to account for its 2016/17 audit by the Auditor-General (AG). Departments facing litigation include Health, with 637 claims amounting to R2,4 billion, Agriculture with 10 claims amounting to R2,9 billion, Education with claims amounting to R832 million, CoGHSTA with R302 million, and the Department of Sport, Arts and Culture to the amount of R297 million. The committee wanted to know what the executing authority was doing to speed up processes relating to the backlog in lawsuits brought against departments over the span of the last five years. In response, the premier’s office representative said the establishment of the Polokwane High Court, and the Labour Court occasionally sitting in the city, would speed up matters of litigation. Matters that would probably not be defended successfully are settled speedily, while civil matters are referred to the regional court to assist in the reduction of the backlog and applications are made to dismiss cases that are not acted upon by the plaintiff after pleadings have closed, the committee was told. Legal advisors are expected to report cases on claims against the state on a quarterly basis to various forums, including the Legal Advisors’ Forum, Stakeholder Management Forum (a joint forum with the Department of Justice), executive management, finance section and the risk committee. The Premier’s Office gives support on litigation matters to all provincial departments, including those with legal advisors, to make informed decisions where necessary in respect of defending claims against the state that are defendable and negotiating the settlement of cases where the settlement thereof will reduce the contingent amount in favour of the state. Phuti Seloba, Provincial Government Spokesperson, said they view the matter as concerning and in a very serious light, and plans are afoot to speed up better outcomes.
