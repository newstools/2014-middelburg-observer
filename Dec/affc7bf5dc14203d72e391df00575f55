A woman was followed and robbed of possessions worth R200 000 in the parking lot of Rochester Place in Rivonia Road, Sandton in Johannesburg.Manisha Algu drove to the doctor after finishing work in Rosebank on Wednesday, arriving at 3.45pm, the Sandton Chronicle reports. I was using my husband s Maserati and I m a small person so they probably identified me as an easy target and presumably followed me. I was just getting out the car when two men came up to me and told me to get back into the car. They were pointing guns at me. They demanded my car keys and when they saw my wedding ring, they took it off my hand. I had just got married last week and hadn t insured the ring worth R160 000. They also took my cellphone and handbag, including my wallet, sun glasses and vouchers, which we had received as wedding gifts, said Algu.She said that once the criminals took what they wanted, their car was stationed behind her and ready to go. They were driving a smart silver golf and they sped off and none of the security guards saw anything. Rochester Place, which houses a number of doctors rooms and laboratories, is guarded by security and the criminals would have received access through a boom gate to enter the property.Building manager Khethang Mmutse said he was informed of the incident on Thursday morning.Rochester Place has video footage of the incident, which they will give to police to assist in the investigation. There are security guards at the gate, but it is difficult to control who comes in because anyone can say that they are going to see a doctor and we can t call the doctor every time to confirm the appointments. It seems like there is nothing we can do, said Mmutse.Sandton police spokesperson Colonel David Mothapo said a case of robbery had been opened and is under investigation.
