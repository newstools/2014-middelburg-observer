Applications for the 2017/18 Blue Flag season are now open, reports the South Coast Herald.However, concerns over whether Trafalgar will be able to retain its Blue Flag status are growing.Following reports on the poor state of amenities and public ablution facilities at the beach, Trafalgar beach has reportedly temporarily lost its Blue Flag.According to Wildlife and Environmental Society of South Africa (Wessa) spokesperson Robert Slater the Blue Flag at the beach was removed last Wednesday, pending the repair of the facilities.Meanwhile, residents who fear the worst want Ray Nkonyeni Municipality to intervene before it s too late.To retain Blue Flag status, four aspects of coastal management have to be up to standard. These are water quality, environmental education and information, environmental management and safety and services.Beach amenities that promote tourism and are safe to use for beachgoers are also considered by Wessa. In this instance, there is no way our beach will retain the Blue Flag because applications are reviewed by a rigorous multistage approval process involving both national and international assessments. The department in charge of beach ablution facilities knows that, said one concerned resident.The municipal spokesperson, Simon April, said they had not yet received a report on the removal of the Blue Flag from the beach, due to the fact that the beach manager was still on leave.He promised, however, to provide an update as soon as they had further information.
