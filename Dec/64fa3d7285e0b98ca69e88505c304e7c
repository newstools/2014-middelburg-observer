EWN reports the state-owned power utility had given Abram Masango until Friday to motivate why he must not be suspended for an incident that happened while he was still the group executive for capital, which includes projects like the Kusile Power Station. Masango is currently the group chief executive in the office of CEO Sean Maritz. “There has been some reports recently about him [Masango] and three other officials who allegedly have received some kickbacks from the Kusile project. So the management of this company is trying to establish the facts around this matter,” Eskom spokesperson Khulu Phasiwe said. In September, Eskom suspended CFO Anoj Singh and former acting CEO Matshela Koko pending disciplinary hearings. Singh was placed on special leave earlier this year in July over his links to Gupta-linked firm Trillian. The Development Bank of South Africa (DBSA) had threatened to recall its R15-billion loan from the power utility if no action was taken against him. Koko is facing disciplinary action over allegations of a conflict of interest. He has been accused of awarding contracts worth billions to Impulse International, a company where his stepdaughter was a shareholder and director, without adhering to Eskom’s supply-chain management policy when he was the group executive for generation. Meanwhile, Eskom’s head of legal, Suzanne Daniels, is fighting her suspension for alleged misconduct. – Caxton News Service Read original story on citizen.co.za
