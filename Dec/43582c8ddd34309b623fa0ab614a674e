Hillcrest police have urged the community to report criminal activities after an increase in cable and copper pipe theft cases.Hillcrest police spokesperson Captain Linzi Smith said the reason behind the dramatic rise in cable theft was because there is a market for scrap metals and cable wire, the Highway Mail reported.She said this is a huge problem for the Hillcrest community, and these thefts include electrical wiring from power stations, telephone lines, railway installations and copper wiring in buildings. Air-conditioning units, plumbing and electrical systems are also vulnerable to the significant rise in cable theft as well. Cable theft is also a huge danger to the community, which includes young children exposed to live wires, which could result in electrocution and death, said Smith.People can report these criminal activities, anonymously if they wish, and call Crime Stop tip off on 086 0010 111 or Hillcrest SAPS on 031 765 9111.
