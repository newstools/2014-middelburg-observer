A preacher, 21, has appeared in the Pinetown Magistrate s Court in Kwa-Zulu Natal on Monday for allegedly raping an eight-year-old boy.The man was arrested last Friday at Gugu Dlamini Park, Durban by the members of the Pinetown Family Violence Child Protection and Sexual offences (FCS) Unit after a search was conducted, Highway Mail reported.Police spokesperson Captain Nqobile Gwala said the detectives were investigating a case of rape which was reported at Hillcrest police station. It is alleged the boys were playing outside a house in KwaNgcolosi when the preacher called one of the boys inside the house and sent the other three to go buy airtime. The boys returned with the airtime and gave it to the preacher, who in turn took it and closed the door while the eight-year-old was still inside the house with him, she said.Gwala said later on, the boys who were playing outside were about to leave and they called the boy from inside the house and they all left. A few days later, the preacher allegedly called another boy but the boy did not go to him. The mother questioned the boy about why he did not go to the preacher. The boy informed her that the last time he was with the preacher, he kissed him. He also told his mother that the preacher slept with one of the boys in the area. The mother was shocked by her son s utterances and approached the mother of the boy which her son alleges the preacher slept with, said Gwala.The mother of the eight-year-old boy immediately opened a case at the Hillcrest Police Station. The case was referred to the Pinetown FCS Unit for investigation.Investigators started looking for the suspected preacher who at the time had left Ngcolosi and was nowhere to be found. Detectives finally arrested the preacher at Gugu Dlamini Park where he was meeting with another preacher, added Gwala. Caxton News ServiceRead original story on highwaymail.co.za
