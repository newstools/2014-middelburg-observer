It is expected that close to 40 witnesses will be called to testify during the portfolio committee on public enterprises’ inquiry into the capture of state owned companies, including but not limited to Eskom, Denel and Transnet. The committee last week issued a statement which spoke of Parliament’s decision to keep the names of the witnesses secret as a measure to counter “security concerns.” The committee is also currently interacting with several witnesses to ensure optimum process.  But one former MP and a fierce critic of Gupta-led state capture Vytjie Mentor may have let the horse bolt on the matter. Although referring to what she calls “Judicial Commission” which the president has so far not issued a proclamation as required by former public protector Adv Thuli Madonsela recommendations, the timelines indicated suggest it may be the same process. Mentor took to Facebook to reveal how, together with the DA and EFF, she plans to “shed my last drop of blood fighting for the country”. She also lamented how her romantic partner “freaked” out. Other witnesses expected to be lined up for the Eskom inquiry in particular will be  Cabinet ministers and Gupta-linked businessman Duduzane Zuma. It will also cast a microscope on the re-appointment of Brian Molefe as the CEO and strive to determine facts around the power utility’s role in the purchasing of Optimal Coal Holdings by the then Gupta-owned Tegeta Exploration. The three Gupta brothers; Eskom suspended CFO Anoj Singh  and suspended former acting CEO Matshela Koko were identified by MPs during the debate on shenanigans at Eskom as people of interest that could help the committee get to the bottom of the looting at the Megawatt-based power utility. Weekend reports alleged that in order to ensure minister Lynne Browne protects him, he directed business deals towards her romantic partner and told associates the minister will not act against him as he has “dirt” on her.
