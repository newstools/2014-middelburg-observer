According to police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Zandra Wiid, three vehicles and a horse-and-trailer were involved in the crash, which occurred at around 1.30pm today. The traffic officer was on duty at a vehicle checkpoint at the time of the crash. Another three people have been seriously injured. According to a Facebook post by the superintendent law enforcement south, Jackson Mzindle, it appears as if the truck driver lost control near the Mpenjathi bridge and ploughed into the vehicles in front, but details are unconfirmed at this stage. Road is closed and traffic to and from Port Edward has been diverted to the Izingolweni Road.  Read original story on southcoastherald.co.za
