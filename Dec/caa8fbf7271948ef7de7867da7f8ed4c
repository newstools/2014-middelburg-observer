Lihle Zilwa, a Grade 4 pupil at Summit College, stunned her family when she told them she would use money from shares they bought for her when she was born to buy learning material for children at a school in Olievenhoutbosch, Fourways Review reports. Lihle, with the help of her parents, gave 21 girls and nine boys from Philena School full school uniforms, and just more than 560 pupils received learning materials, which include colouring books, alphabet charts, stationery and books for the school library.teachers were given fans to keep the classrooms cool. The nine-year-old stated that it was her decision and she would not have felt great if she spent the money on herself only. She added: “I felt sad when I heard that there are children whose families can’t afford a school uniform while others have uniforms, I wanted to help. I believe each and every person can make a difference in the lives of the many people who do not have enough food, clothes or comfortable homes. You need to look around you and see how you can help.” Her parents, Sindi and Sva Zilwa, said their daughter had always had a giving heart. At the age of four, she surprised them when she made multicoloured thread bracelets and necklaces that she sold and gave proceeds to children from an orphanage. Sindi said: “I am still bursting with pride and thank God for such a kind, responsible, selfless baby.” Her father Sva said he was amazed by his daughter’s giving heart and thoughtfulness, and her wish to give other children an opportunity to advance themselves in education. Philena Primary School principal David Mogashoa said the school was thankful to Lihle. Summit College principal said the school was very proud of her. Cherly Naidoo added: “It’s amazing to see a young person so in tune with other people’s needs. We are proud of Lihle and awarded her our school’s Ellie Award for showing such kindness and humanity.” – Caxton News Service Read original story on fourwaysreview.co.za
