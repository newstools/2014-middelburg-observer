Thieves have broken into the same church 10 times, reports The Citizen.The most recent break-in at the Full Gospel Church in Eersterus, Pretoria, was on Wednesday.Thieves even broke into the church on Good Friday night.Just in the past month alone, there have been three break-ins, despite the church having an alarm system.Pastor Walter Volkwyn said the church gate had been taken, as well as the taps and a urinal in the men s bathroom, a sound mixer and computer screen. These break-ins have cost us more than R60 000. Every time, we have to spend money on fixing locks, broken doors or windows. According to Volkwyn, the person who stole the gate confessed to his mother. He told his mother that he is the one who stole the gate and that he was sorry. He said he felt as if he was going crazy after the theft and that his conscience was driving him insane. We managed to get the gate back and after he was arrested, the church wrote to the court to ask that he be set free as we felt he learnt his lesson. We never had problems with him again. Volkwyn said the church members were feeling the financial effects of the break-ins as they contributed financially to the church s upkeep.Police spokesperson Sam Shibambo said they were investigating the case.
