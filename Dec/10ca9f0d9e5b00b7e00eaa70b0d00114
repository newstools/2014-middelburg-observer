Pauw is now facing criminal charges for publishing a host of exclusive details about the State Security Agency (SSA) in his new book, The President’s Keepers. According to Times LIVE, the charge sheet is yet to be revealed, but Lieutenant-Colonel Lungelo Dlamini, the Gauteng provincial police spokesperson, confirmed the charges. Pauw said he had not yet been informed of the charges. Yesterday at his book launch in Hyde Park, he told the audience he had received a second ‘cease and desist’ letter from the lawyers of SSA. Last week, the SSA gave Pauw and his publisher, NB Publishers, five days to comply with the same order or the spy agency would approach the high court to seek appropriate remedy against the publication of the book, including instituting criminal charges against Pauw and his publisher. The SSA argued the book was riddled with many inaccuracies of a criminal nature, constituted a violation of the relevant intelligent statutes and compromised the security of the state. Meanwhile, Pauw has urged readers to continue supporting his book, as the proceeds were likely to go toward a court case against SSA and the other state organisations named in the book, including Sars. – Caxton News Service Read original story on citizen.co.za
