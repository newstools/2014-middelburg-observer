While people were misled into thinking they had to wait 24 hours before reporting a missing person, Mbalula there was no such thing as a waiting period. When a person goes missing, it is of the utmost importance for the SAPS to fulfil our mandate to serve and protect the citizens of South Africa.

This we have changed to make our investigations into missing persons quicker to resolve. When you suspect your loved one is missing, immediately report to your nearest police station with their most recent photograph, an investigator will be allocated to your case and an investigation to find the person will immediately kick-start. While acknowledging the usefulness of Social Media in spreading the message, I will stress the importance of reporting to your nearest SAPS Police Station, said Mbalula.However, this needed members of the public to help in reporting such matters.
