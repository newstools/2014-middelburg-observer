This is the opinion of the Federation of Governing Bodies of South African Schools (FEDSAS) regarding the proposed Basic Education Laws Amendment Bill. The Bill was announced by the former minister of higher education, Blade Nzimande on October 13 and is aimed at limiting certain functions of school governing bodies, including being able to make recommendations about appointments, admissions and language policies as well as certain financial functions. “This Amendment Bill takes us back to a model where the state controls everything. It goes against the spirit of the South African Schools’ Act, which provides for public schools and not state schools,” said Dr Jaco Deacon, deputy CEO of FEDSAS. “Parents should take note of the fact that the proposed Bill places a limitation on the right of parents to make decisions about their children’s education. In essence, it is a violation of the Constitution as school governing bodies enable parents to be involved in decision making.”    Deacon says it is of paramount importance that parents be involved in formal school governance structures… “If governing bodies do not function properly or if parents and other education role-players are not involved in these structures it strengthens the claim made with this Bill.” The Basic Education Laws Amendment Bill proposes, among other, that governing bodies play no role in the appointment of school-level heads of department, deputy principals and principals. “If the serious shortcomings in the proposed Bill are not pointed out and changed we will spend millions on reactive court cases and other actions. “Now we have the opportunity to be proactive. However, this can only happen if all education role-players commit, comment and create awareness about the implications,” he concluded.
