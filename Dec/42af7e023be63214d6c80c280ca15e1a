A legal representative of the former deputy minister of Higher Education Mduduzi Manana paid his R100 000 fine in cash at the Randburg Magistrates’ Court on Tuesday. On Monday, Magistrate Ramsamy Reddy ordered that Manana pay a R100 000 fine or spend 12 months behind bars. Manana was also sentenced to 500 hours of community service, ordered to attend counselling and pay each of the victims the damage claims submitted by the state. Manana was convicted of three counts of assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm after pleading guilty to the charges. The charges relate to the assault of three women at Cubana in Fourways on August 6. Nqobizitha Mlilo, acting for Manana, said that an arrangement was made with the court to make payment after the noon cut-off time as the former deputy minister was resuming his 500 hours of community service. The former deputy minister of higher education has been given a week to pay the damage claims to Mandisa Duma, Noluthando Mahlaba and Thina Mopipa. Sentencing proceedings of his co-accused Cyril Madonsela and Thulani Mdaka, who also pleaded guilty to assaulting Mahlaba and Mopipa, will start on Thursday. – Caxton News Service Read original story on citizen.co.za
