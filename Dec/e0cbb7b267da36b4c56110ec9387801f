His car was set alight while he was in the vehicle. At the time, the company said the driver was receiving treatment in hospital.Later in the month, on June 27, the Centurion Rekord further reported that a video showing a vehicle engulfed in flames in Sunnyside had gone viral and that it was believed that the vehicle was petrol-bombed.The footage was posted to social media and shows the vehicle moving backwards toward traffic.Police could not immediately confirm that the vehicle set on fire was, in fact, an Uber taxi. The Rosebank Killarney Gazette contacted Uber after social media reports stated that vehicle in question was an Uber taxi and Uber confirmed that it was not one of their vehicles and that this incident was not related to them.
