Metro police have halted a protest that brought the N2 to a complete standstill this morning.The go-slow on the highway began shortly before 8am near the old Durban airport.It is believed the tow truck drivers are making their way towards La Lucia.The protest is related to the march meant to take place on Armstrong Avenue later today, the Northglen News reported.It is understood several tow truck vehicles have been impounded.Metro police spokesperson Sibonelo Mchunu confirmed police had dispersed the drivers. We have been dealing with various service delivery protests this morning in Sibaya, Verulam, and the N2. We have not arrested any drivers, but we have managed to disperse the drivers, he said.Traffic is still slow moving on the N2 going north.uMhlanga ward councillor Heinz de Boer praised the metro for their response. I m glad the metro police stepped in. They did the right thing. It is my understanding some of the vehicles been impounded which is great. I think it s important to recognise the right of citizens to demonstrate, but I don t think it was necessary to block the N2 highway. The blockade has taken away the power of the people trying to get their point across on Armstrong Avenue today, he said.The peaceful protest on Armstrong Avenue is going ahead and the group plan to hand over a memorandum of demands to an insurance business in the area later today.
