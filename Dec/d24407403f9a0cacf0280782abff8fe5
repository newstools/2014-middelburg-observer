Then she put my daughter on the phone, and I could hear the trembling and fear in her voice, said Lizette. All that remains a distraught Pieter Greeff inspects the damage to his gutted home PHOTO Orrin SinghBefore being joined by uMhlathuze firefighters, some residents and Alpha Security were on the scene in an attempt to put out the fire, but the flat was completely gutted in about 30 minutes.An emotional Lizette said she was grateful that her daughter was safe during the ordeal. Fortunately, it s only earthly things that were destroyed, and no one was harmed, she said.Husband Pieter said they had lost everything in the blaze. We have nothing except the clothes on our backs.

I ve arranged, with permission from the family, for any donations to be dropped off at Walk in Faith at my home at 38 Raphia Palm, Arboretum. I will arrange for the donated items to be delivered to them twice a week, she said.The Greeffs will be attending counselling sessions to deal with the traumatic experience.The cause of the fire is being investigated.
