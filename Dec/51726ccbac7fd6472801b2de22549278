The sentencing proceedings of the former deputy minister of higher education Mduduzi Manana, who is charged with assault, were postponed on Tuesday by the Randburg Magistrate’s Court. Defence representative Michael Motswaneng Bill said they only received the probation officer’s report on Monday and the correctional services report on Tuesday morning which meant they had not been able to review both reports. State prosecutor Anne-Marie Smith agreed with the defence to postpone the matter. Magistrate Ramsamy Reddy questioned what had happened during the course of an eight-week postponement. “There was a lot of consultation to do and the time granted was not enough,” Smith replied. Magistrate Reddy granted the postponement. The sentencing of Manana’s co-accused was also postponed in another courtroom to 16 November. The matter will resume on Wednesday. Manana pleaded guilty to two counts of assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm for hitting two women at a Cubana nightclub earlier this year. The public uproar eventually led to him stepping down from his position as deputy minister. – Caxton News Service   Read original story on citizen.co.za
