A video of Menlyn Mall security guards escorting out a woman over her dress code has surfaced. In the video, a woman can be seen wearing a long-sleeved white top with slits up to her hips and boots being escorted out of the mall in Pretoria, with a jeering mob following them.A Facebook user who took and shared the video wrote: Yah neh the things we see at Menlyn Mall this chick is wearing nothing but that white top. Panty dololo, she s even walking confidently ke bone di dombie [butt cheeks]. She further said the security officer wanted the woman to leave the mall but changed her mind and let her get in to a shop to buy pants.While some criticised the woman for dressing like that in public, one slammed the lady who took the video and said she was not decent for taking that video. It actually does make me a decent lady I am very proud of my body but I don t go around showing it to the whole world for attention. She s a grown lady, probably a mother and has to be an example to her kids. She can show her beauty in different ways. By the way she put herself in that uncomfortable situation, she said in her defence.-Caxton News ServiceRead original story on citizen.co.za
