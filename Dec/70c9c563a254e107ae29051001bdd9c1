The R21 between Olifantsfontein Road and Nellmapius Drive is still closed in both directions after a truck collided into a high voltage pylon earlier on Friday morning, reports the Kempton Express.According to Ekurhuleni metro police spokesperson, Kobeli Mokheseng, Eskom is currently on site trying to figure out what to do to reset the pylon to its maximum height so trucks can also pass underneath once the road has been cleared. This is a very big problem and will probably take the whole day. We advise motorists travelling towards Pretoria to take the Bapsfontein (R25) off-ramp towards Old Pretoria Road, said Mokheseng.Apparently cables have fallen onto the roadway.Gauteng &#8211; R21 Highway, ROAD CLOSED: download the @TrafficSA App to get updates on this incident https://t.co/HruIInj3ti @ortambo_int pic.twitter.com/SCHt1UQgod&mdash; TrafficSA (@TrafficSA) May 19, 2017Trying to get more information from the emergency services, Kempton Express was referred to Tshwane EMS by Ekurhuleni EMS en vice versa.
