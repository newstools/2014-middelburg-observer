Reports of intimidation from the African National Congress Youth League (ANCYL) and fears of enormous traffic jams have left locals with mixed feelings on the opening of the Ballito Junction Regional Mall tomorrow.The ANCYL s threat to take over Ballito by bringing in up to 10 000 people to protest the opening has set residents and many of the mall s new tenents on edge.Ballito Ashton International College, situated next to the M4 enterance to Ballito, has notified parents that they will be closed tomorrow.The letter from the school states that SAPS, the UIP and the school s security company strongly recommended the school close for the day in light of the march.A photo of the letter is doing the rounds and is causing much consternation.However, Ballito UIP security manager Dieter Fittkau said the recommendation was based on the traffic jams that are expected tomorrow. In view of the protest march that took place on November 4 last year by relatively few participants that unfortunately resulted in severe traffic congestion in the upper Ballito area, it was felt that the school traffic at midday, combined with the decidedly larger group of protesters and the high traffic volumes expected with the opening of The Junction, would result in a prolonged period of frustration that was prudent to avoid. The UIP s interest lies in the M4 and the P445 as being part of managed areas and past history of these areas necessitated their recommendation, said Fittkau.A domestic worker from Entabeli, who asked not to be named, said her peers travelling to Ballito feared the league would force them to march. This morning everyone in the taxi was talking about how they are worried they will be able to make it to work tomorrow. I will leave home at about 6am because I am scared that if I leave later I will be stopped. A Ballito resident, who asked not to be named for her domestic worker s sake, said her employee was questioned by the ANCYL members about why she chose to work in Ballito and not in the area she came from. My domestic worker lives in KwaMashu. She was approached at the train station this morning by members from the ANCYL. They wanted her to her join the march tomorrow. The march is set to start at 8am from the Sofaya Sport Field in Ntshawini (KwaDukuza) and will move down the R102 to Shaka s Head before making its way over the bridge to the traffic lights opposite The Junction via the P445 (Ballito Drive).The march is expected to end at 5pm.The ANCYL could not be reached for comment.&#8211; Caxton News ServiceRead original story on northcoastcourier.co.za
