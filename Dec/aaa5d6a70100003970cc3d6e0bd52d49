Three suspects held in connection with the attempted hijacking of actor Dumi Masilela have been charged for his murder. Gauteng community safety MEC Sizakele Nkosi-Malobane told The Sowetan that there were processes that had to be followed with regards to ballistic results and ID parade. “We could not just charge them,” she was quoted as saying. It was reported last month that fingerprints had successfully linked one of the two men arrested in connection to the attempted hijacking of Masilela to the incident. Masilela had been parked in his car in Tembisa on August 2 when a black Jeep approached and a shot was fired at him as he tried to drive away. He was hit by the bullet and later died in hospital. During proceedings at the Benoni Magistrates’ Court, state prosecutor Lumka Phoswa said that one set of fingerprints that were found in the hijacked Jeep Wrangler that was apparently involved in the incident last month was positively linked to Mfundo Nkosi. Nkosi and Bongani Masombuka were found in possession of a hijacked Jeep Wrangler that was allegedly used in the attempted hijacking of Masilela, as well as in possession of an unlicensed firearm. The duo are facing charges of robbery with aggravating circumstances. “Accused one [Masombuka] has been linked via 205 [cellphone records],” Phoswa told the court. Phoswa added the second set of fingerprints were suspected to belong to a man who was in custody at the Germiston Police Station after he was found in possession of an unlicensed firearm that Nkosi claimed was used to shoot at Masilela.
