One of President Jacob Zuma s key allies, the Umkhonto WeSizwe Military Veteran s Association (MKMVA), has been hit by a division, reports The Citizen.That was evident yesterday when a number of the MKMVA s key national executive committee members boycotted a conference which was addressed by Zuma.The boycotters said the holding of the conference was contrary to attempts to unite the various MK veteran factions.The MKMVA, which has strongly supported Zuma and has been accused of intimidating some of his critics, is opposed by the MK National Council.Yesterday s conference was organised by MKMVA chairperson Kebby Maphatsoe in what some of his national executive committee members considered was in defiance of efforts by ANC secretary-general Gwede Mantashe to get the organisation to talk to the MK National Council, which is headed by former defence force chief General Siphiwe Nyanda.Mantashe had wanted the groups to hold a joint conference.The MKMVA leaders who boycotted yesterday s gathering were deputy chairperson Teenage Monama, secretary general Dumisani Nduli, deputy secretary general Tshidiso Paka and MKMVA NEC member Ike Moroe.The MKMVA boycotters said about 60% percent of the delegates at the MKMVA conference were not bona fide MK military veterans. A number of recent reports said MKMVA members present at the organisation s demonstrations were as young as 30 and did not qualify as veterans.But in his address yesterday, Zuma described those who attended as former commanders, commissars and gallant combatants of MK who represented different generations of the best cadres and whose understanding of issues was scientific .Appealing to members to close ranks and not engage in muddy politics , he said the conference was part of continued efforts to unite members and find solutions to the challenges facing the ANC.He asked the former cadres to take full advantage of the upcoming ANC policy and national conferences to resolve their problems.
