Cosatu says President Jacob Zuma attended the Workers Day rally in Bloemfontein despite an invitation being extended to the ANC and not him personally, reports The Citizen.Zuma was prevented from speaking after large sections of the crowd heckled him and sang derogatory songs calling for him to step down.He was eventually forced to leave the event, with Cosatu cancelling all speeches that were set to delivered on the day. ANC NEC member Naledi Pandor and Cosatu president Sdumo Dlamini were also booed at the event. We did not invite President Zuma to speak in our rally Cosatu general secretary Bheki Ntshalintshali told Justice Malala on the Justice Factor on eNCA on Monday night.Political economy analyst Zamikhaya Maseti said the chaos clearly showed Cosatu was losing touch with the workers. The workers rebellion at the May Day event is a clear indication that S dumo Dlamini has no control of the affiliates, Maseti said.Although some affiliates made their views known and advised Cosatu that they did not want Zuma to address the rally, Dlamini did not listen, he said. I guess he was showing some strength and control. Unfortunately, his credibility is now shredded, Maseti said. Caxton News ServiceRead original story on citizen.co.za
