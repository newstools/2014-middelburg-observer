Being called a “stabane” (gay) did not give former deputy education minister Mduduzi Manana the right to assault three women in a Johannesburg nightclub, a Randburg magistrate said as he sentenced him to 12 months imprisonment or a fine of R100 000 on Monday. While handing down his sentence at the Randburg Magistrates’ Court, Magistrate Ramsamy Reddy said: “It was degrading for them as women to experience such a degrading act.” Manana was also ordered to complete 500 hours of community service. Last week, Michael Motswaneng Bill, for Manana, said he was willing to compensate his victims, do 500 hours of community service while being monitored by the social worker and to undergo 12 months imprisonment, wholly suspended  for five years, on condition that he does not commit a similar offence. Manana had been convicted of three counts of assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm after pleading guilty to the charges. The charges relate to the assault of three women at Cubana in Fourways on August 6. – Caxton News Service   Read original story on citizen.co.za
