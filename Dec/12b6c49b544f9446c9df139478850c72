Following reports of a vehicle on a carrier truck catching fire on the N2 between Buffalo Bay and Sedgefield in the Western Cape on Monday, the organisers of the Jaguar Simola Hillclimb confirmed the truck was carrying several vehicles that had competed in the Knysna-based motor racing event over the weekend, reports the Knysna-Plett Herald.There are no reports of anyone being injured in the incident. One of the vehicles reportedly caught fire while in transit, and the fire spread rapidly, causing extensive damage to the other vehicles.Ian Shrosbree, managing director of Knysna Speed Festival and organiser and founder of the Jaguar Simola Hillclimb, expressed his dismay and distress after hearing of the incident. After the resounding success of the last three days where each of the participating vehicles becomes part of the essence of the competition this disaster impacts on us all. The loss of complete vehicles (some of them one-of-a-kind and literally irreplaceable) and the damage to others cannot be quantified. It is much, much more than just the value of what has gone up in flames. The cause of the fire is unclear at this stage, but will be investigated. The value of the affected vehicles has not yet been determined.Watch this video by Wessel van Heerden: Caxton News ServiceRead original story on www.knysnaplettherald.com
