The Garden Route SPCA (GR SPCA) dispatched five teams of inspectors in four vehicles to Knysna Animal Welfare Society (Kaws) on Wednesday, June 7, reports the Knysna-Plett Herald.They returned with 60 animals, which were housed at the two branches of the GR SPCA in George and Mossel Bay, freeing up space for Kaws to take in more animals.&#8220;The scene we saw was shocking,&#8221; said senior inspector Salome Bruyns.&#8220;The trees next to the highway were still burning and there was thick smoke along the road. When we got into Knysna some houses were still on fire and the traffic was very bad.&#8221;SPCA inspectors combed the burnt areas in Hoekwil, Karatara, Buffalo Bay, Sedgefield, Harkerville and Knysna, looking for any injured wild, domestic or farm animals. They re-visited Hoekwil where a troop of baboons had been seen on the road the previous night. None were found.&#8220;Our thoughts are with everyone who was affected by this disaster, including our own GR SPCA Vet, Dr Anesca Loots, who lost her home in Knysna to the fires. We wish to thank everyone who assisted us by transporting animals, donating food and giving other essential items like blankets. We have had donations and calls from as far afield as the UK, Namibia and Nelspruit. It is heart-warming to know that the public stands together in need,&#8221; said GR SPCA manager Frieda Jansen van Rensburg.Please report any displaced, stray or injured animals to Kaws in Knysna on 044 384 1603 or the GR SPCA on 044 878 1990/1993 or on the after-hours emergency line 082 378 7384, and give as much information as possible.
