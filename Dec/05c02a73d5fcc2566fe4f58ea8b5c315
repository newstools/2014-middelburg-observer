The office of the public protector in Pretoria has confirmed it is investigating former African Union (AU) chairperson Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma for alleged abuse of VIP presidential protection as a private citizen, reports The Citizen.Spokesperson Cleopatra Mosana said it was still early days in the investigation. For now we can confirm that there is an investigation. There are certain internal processes we have to go through, she said.The DA launched a formal complaint with the office of the public protector on April 18.Former acting national police commissioner Lieutenant-General Khomotso Phahlane previously confirmed to parliament that Dlamini-Zuma continued to be protected by the unit while she travels around South Africa for ANC campaigning.DA shadow minister of police Zakhele Mbhele said: It has now been almost two months since the Dlamini-Zuma VIP scandal came to light and there are no indications that Police Minister Fikile Mbalula has put a stop to it. He is allowing an obscene bill to run up. Her use of the unit while campaigning is clearly another ANC abuse of public money. Caxton News ServiceRead original story on citizen.co.za
