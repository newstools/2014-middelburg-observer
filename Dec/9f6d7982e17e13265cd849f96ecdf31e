Tshwane mayor Solly Msimanga came under fire from the ANC yesterday when he announced in his new budget that water and electricity would cost 10.2% and 1.8% more respectively, reports The Citizen.Calling these exorbitant price increases, ANC leader in council Mapiti Matsena said the DA was clearly not a caring government . He added: [Msimanga] said he was not going to substantially increase the rates and taxes but he put in this exorbitant increase. Msimanga blamed the poor planning of the previous administration for the bill that had led to tariff hikes. He added that Eskom and Rand Water tariffs had also influenced the price increases.The cost of refuse removal was also hiked 7.5%, while property tariffs were based on the new valuation roll. The total account is expected to increase by 2%. As far as property rates go, the rate has been reduced. This means that in the 2016-17 financial year, an account holder paid R394.54 for property rates.In the upcoming 2017-18 financial year, the Tshwane account holder will pay R346.43. This is a R48.11 decrease, he said. Attempting to quash speculation the city s free Wi-Fi service is to be scuppered, he said: Free Wi-Fi is here to stay.
