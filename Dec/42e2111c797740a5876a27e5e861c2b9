African National Congress chief whip in parliament Jackson Mthembu says Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa should not be the only ANC member to be criticised for announcing his “winning team” ahead of the governing party’s upcoming national conference next month. This after ANC secretary-general Gwede Mantashe on Monday described as unacceptable presidential hopefuls announcing “a lineup of comrades to be elected as officials”. In an unprecedented move at the weekend, Ramaphosa named Science and Technology Minister Naledi Pandor as his deputy, along with three other ANC leaders for the party’s top six positions, should he be elected as President Jacob Zuma’s successor at the congress. The ANC Youth League and the governing party in KwaZulu-Natal also slammed the deputy president for announcing his slate. Mthembu, a known staunch supporter of Ramaphosa’s presidential campaign, said the criticism should not only be levelled at Ramaphosa, but on all ANC members who have publicly announced their preferred candidates. “The criticism should not only be directed at him [Cyril Ramaphosa]. You know that many people have pronounced their slates, including the president, who announced comrade Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, and Bathabile [Dlamini] long ago,” Mthembu told Talk Radio 702 on Thursday morning.
