A bitter fall-out between Brown and Ngubane over who would replace former CEO Brian Molefe is what led to the resignation of the state utility board head.City Press reports Ngubane was pushing for Zethembe Khoza to take over the vacant position of CEO. Khoza has previously acted as CEO from March to April 2015 and is the founder of an investment firm.According to two sources, Brown rejected Ngubane s proposal of Khoza and he was instead appointed interim board chairperson of the embattled parastatal. This was confirmed by Brown in a statement issued on Monday.Ngubane is said to have threatened to report Brown to President Jacob Zuma for not following his wishes. He threatened to resign if the minister didn t appoint this guy; the minister told him to go ahead, said one source.Another source said Brown was unfazed by further threats to have Zuma intervene in the matter.Khoza has since filed legal papers at the labour court stating Eskom would no oppose Molefe s challenge to his dismissal, leaving Brown to defend it alone. Brown has responded, saying Molefe s reappointment was not legally valid. I submit Mr Molefe has therefore, not been dismissed as he claims. His reinstatement as CEO was premised on an invalid agreement. I directed the board to rescind the illegal reinstatement. The ANC meanwhile said Ngubane is not off the hook just yet. ANC spokesperson Zizi Kodwa said he should still be held accountable. If there is any wrongdoing from him or any person, whether they resign or not, they must take responsibility. Allegations of corruption and looting are quite serious, Kodwa told EWN . We need good corporate governance. The utility must clean itself of corruption allegations because people are saying that our utility has been captured. Caxton News ServiceRead original story on citizen.co.za
