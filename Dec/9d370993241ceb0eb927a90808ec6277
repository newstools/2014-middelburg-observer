THE petrol price will increase by 4 cents per litre in November while the price of diesel will increase by 23 cents per litre. That’s according to the Department of Energy. “South Africa’s fuel prices are adjusted on a monthly basis, informed by international and local factors. International factors include the fact that South Africa imports both crude oil and finished products at a price set at the international level, including shipping costs,” they said in a statement. The department said one of the reasons for the fuel price adjustments is the Rand/US Dollar Exchange rate. “The Rand weakened, on average, against the US Dollar (from 13.13 to 13:62 Rand per USD) during the period under review,” the department said. The price of Illuminating Paraffin (wholesale) will increase by 21 cents per litre and the maximum LPGas Retail Price will increase by 17c/kg. “The average prices of petrol and illuminating paraffin decreased, while the diesel prices increased, during the period under review. This led to an over-recovery of about 17 cents per litre on petrol and about 2.5 cents per litre on paraffin,” the department said. Read original story on northglennews.co.za
