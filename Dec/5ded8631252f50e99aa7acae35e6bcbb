In a very unexpected move, SA celebrities are rallying behind Cassper Nyovest, not just in word, but in deed, as they have offered to buy tickets to his Fill Up FNB Stadium concert in December. AKA on Friday said he would be willing to perform at the show, should Cassper give him a “mill”. He said the two did not have to be friends, but only had to swallow their beef and work together to fill the 75 000-capacity stadium. Cassper turned down AKA’s offer, and said while it all about making money for AKA, he was all about making history. The Mama I Made It hit maker said he was not looking for artists who would be looking to make money from the show, but those who were prepared to spend it to make his dream a reality. The hashtag #JustBuyTheTicketBroer has been trending since, with fans all over Africa showing their support for Cassper. Since then, Police Minister Fikile Mbalula has offered to buy 10 tickets to the concert in support of Cassper’s dream. Then followed DJ Black Coffee, who said he would be spending R20 000 every Friday on tickets until the show. Read original story on citizen.co.za
