A man was allegedly gang-raped by three young women after they drugged him to sleep.The 23-year-old had caught a taxi last week on Solomon Mahlangu Drive in Nellmaphius in Mamelodi, with three young female passengers inside, police spokesperson Captain Colette Weilbach said.But en route to the CBD, the driver changed direction and the young man was ordered to move to the front of taxi, she said. Apparently one of the women injected him with an unknown substance and he passed out. He stated that he woke up in an unfamiliar room on a single bed. One of the women then allegedly forced him to drink an energy drink before the ladies took turns raping him throughout the day.They dropped him off at an open field in Benoni on Sunday afternoon, where the traumatised man was able to receive medical treatment. [We] take all sexual offences seriously regardless of gender. The Tshwane central cluster assures all victims of these types of crimes that they will carry out robust investigations to bring offenders to justice, Weilbach said.
