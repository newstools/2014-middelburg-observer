The Cabinet reshuffle by President Jacob Zuma is a clear sign that South Africa has now been plunged into a democratic mafia state.This was the opinion of the political analyst Elvis Masoga.Zuma had made the announcement, which saw Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan being sacked, in the early hours of Friday.Speaking to Saturday Citizen on Friday, Masoga said the reshuffle, which has angered many South Africans, shows how underground mafias have captured some political leaders.He said Zuma s latest move also means he clearly and openly had defied the ANC, something which has never happened in the history of the ruling party since 1994.Masoga warned that Zuma is likely to be forcefully removed by ordinary citizens, if the ANC does not recall him.Another analyst, professor Andre Duvenhage, said this was only the beginning of a bigger conflict within the ANC and may involve other top leaders. There is no doubt that there is strong resistance against Zuma both at grassroots and elite level and that will remain for sometime until he resigns or is recalled, Duvenhage said.
