Former Eskom CEO Brian Molefe on Thursday asked Labour Court in Johannesburg to refer his unfair dismissal case for arbitration or trial.At issue is a Pretoria High Court application lodged by the DA following Molefe s controversial reinstatement in May despite his public resignation from the power utility in December last year after being implicated in the public protector s State of Capture report, SowetanLIVE reported.The application will be heard in the high court in August, and is opposed by the EFF and Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown.According to the report, Molefe s lawyer Noel Graves SC asked Judge Christina Prinsloo to stay the current proceedings because the court would have difficulty resolving factual matters contained in the court papers.This related to Brown s version in the high court regarding his resignation from Eskom and subsequent return, which differed from Molefe s Labour Court application.The DA s lawyers asked for this application to be struck from the roll, while the EFF argued that Molefe could not bring an urgent application and then seek a postponement, and asked for the request to be dismissed.The case continues.
