On Thursday afternoon, the devastating fires in the Knysna area were far from being contained.This is according to Gerhard Otto, head of Eden District Disaster Management.Otto spoke to the George Herald after a briefing with the Western Cape Premier Helen Zille at the Eden District Municipality Disaster Centre on Thursday afternoon. A joint operation of government emergency services is making all efforts trying to put down the fire which runs all the way to Plettenberg Bay. According to Otto, the first fire started in the Kruisfontein plantation to the east of Knysna which could have been caused by someone lighting a match in the forest. We are investigating a case of arson. I was informed that the second fire on the western side in the Karatara area could be related to a controlled burn that was done four days ago. We believe that the strong berg wind caused a smoking ember to catch alight. There is a false sense of security in the area as there is a lull in the wind, but we are expecting the wind to pick-up this evening. The fire has so far destroyed over 140 to 150 houses in the greater Knysna area and about 25 homes on the millionaire s mile between the Beacon Isle Hotel and Robberg Nature Reserve, said Otto.Helen Zille leaving the JOC heading to Knysna this afternoon.
