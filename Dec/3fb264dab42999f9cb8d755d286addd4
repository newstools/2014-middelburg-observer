The municipality of Madibeng has been paying R3 060 per day, and extras, for renting the luxury vehicle for the mayor, Kormorant reports. During a council meeting this week, when the DA asked how much had already been paid for the rental vehicle, the municipality replied that the DA “must specify the exact period”. According to information, the municipality has been renting the vehicle for more than six months, and has asked the municipality for the exact period. They have not replied. The municipality paid R934 579 for a BMW X5 for the mayor in the 2014/2015 financial year, and now wants to buy a new one. The specifications and make of the vehicle will be determined by the municipal manager with the mayor. The BMW is seemingly broken. At a question by the DA why the car is being used for private transport, the municipality replied it has only been used for official purposes, but quoted the mayoral handbook that states “it is left to the discretion of mayors to utilise the vehicle at the expense of the municipality for any reasonable purposes”. The municipality has also been questioned about the rental of a stall at the Nedbank Golf Challenge for a whopping R104 178. The municipality replied it had identified the event as one of the key events to promote Madibeng as a tourism destination. They paid R34 200 for a fabric banner, R17 158 for stall furniture, R37 620 for the stall rent and R15 200 for accommodation. – Caxton News  Service Read original story on citizen.co.za
