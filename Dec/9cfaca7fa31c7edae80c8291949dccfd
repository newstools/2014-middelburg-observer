Pretoria High Court Judge Billy Motlhe has ruled that anti-apartheid activist Ahmed Timol did not commit suicide when he allegedly jumped off the 10th floor of the John Vorster Square Police Station 45 years ago, but was instead pushed to death while being tortured by security police. Motlhe found that former security police clerk Jan Rodrigues, the last man to Timol see alive, should be investigated as an accessory to murder and perjury. The inquest into Timol’s death was reopened after the family found new evidence that proved Timol did not commit suicide, but instead was killed, in police custody in October 1971.
