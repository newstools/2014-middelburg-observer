Modise joined City at the beginning of the season after six successful seasons with Sundowns. The former Bafana Bafana midfielder has recently claimed in his autobiography, The Curse of Teko Modise, that he left Sundowns because of a breakdown in his relationship with Mosimane. Mosimane, however, says he never said Modise must leave Sundowns. “I saw the goals he scored, the passes he made, he is a legend – a very good footballer and talent. “I am happy that I was part of his story with him from the beginning to the end, and it is a good story. He will tell you that I never said he must go, and I never said his contract must not be renewed,” Mosimane told TimesLive. The former Bafana Bafana coach, however, admits it was becoming difficult for him to find a place in his starting XI for Modise. “I always told you in the media that as long as he was at Sundowns, he will remain like Surprise Moriri or any other legend of the club. He opted to go. He wanted game time, and he was right because he was not playing here, and why must he stick around? “It was very difficult for him because Tiyani Mabunda has got quick and strong legs. Hlompho Kekana is still in the space, and I play two in midfield. So it was a little bit of a difficult situation. He was right to go and play elsewhere.” Modise is set make an emotional return to Pretoria when Cape Town City face Sundowns in a league match at Loftus Versfeld Stadium on Tuesday night. – Caxton News Service  Would you like to place a soccer bet? Click here to get started in 3 easy steps.
