The possibility that slain gender activist Karabo Mokoena was burnt alive, allegedly by her partner Sandile Mantsoe, has not been ruled out, the Johannesburg Magistrate s Court heard on Friday, reports The Citizen.This emerged during Mantsoe s bail application. Bail was denied to the 27-year-old forex trader by magistrate Carlo Labuschagne.Labuschagne recounted state evidence suggesting Mantsoe, who insisted he believed Mokoena had committed suicide, admitted to dousing her body with pool acid and petrol before setting it alight in a field in Lyndhurst. He pointed the place out to the police where he burnt the body. It is not clear at this stage whether she was alive or dead when she was set alight as the post-mortem report is still outstanding. Mantsoe s defence advocate, Victor Simelane, argued his client was not a flight risk as he had ties in this country .But state prosecutor John Metswamere said Mantsoe had the resources to flee to avoid trial.He also pointed out several holes in Mantsoe s version. He did not disclose what position she was in when he got to his apartment and found she was dead. Was the deceased hanging? Did she hang herself? Did he notice if the deceased took an overdose? The case goes to trial on July 28. Caxton News ServiceRead original story on citizen.co.za
