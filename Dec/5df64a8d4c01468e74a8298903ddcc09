KwaZulu-Natal MEC for transport, community safety and liaison Mxolisi Kaunda was briefed by police management on the progress made since the intervention by the national and provincial governments to fight the rampant vehicle theft in the Manguzi area.According to the Zululand Observer, recently this was achieved when the police involved in the syndicate were arrested, and the recovery of some of the stolen vehicles and drugs worth millions of rands.This follows after President Zuma s visit earlier this year, where he engaged with members of the community, committing to step up efforts in fighting cross-border crime.Kaunda visited KwaSkhemelele, uMkhanyakude District, where he was briefed on the recovery of seven vehicles since April, and the arrest of three police officers in Kosi Bay.The latest arrests brings to 14 the number of police detained for their crime involvement along the border.A suspect was also arrested transporting drugs, with a street value of R140 million, from Mozambique to Gauteng.Addressing the community during the opening of the KwaSkhemelele Satellite Police Station, Kaunda reaffirmed the government s commitment in fighting cross-border crime. We are pleased with the progress recorded here since the intervention by President Zuma. The recovery of seven vehicles, as well as the eight recovered in Pongola is an indication of a high level of dedication by the police. We will continue to arrest more police officers who are involved in criminal activities because we want to clean up our system. The progress we are making here is tangible evidence that, as government, we take the concerns raised by our community seriously. We have also achieved a lot in building trust between the police and the community, resulting in improved information sharing, Kaunda said.MEC Kaunda, the mayors and iNkosi Mabhudu Tembe then led a walkabout and engaged with the business community in the area, mobilising them to join the movement to fight crime.The opening of KwaSkhemelele Satellite Police Station will improve policing in the corridor between uMhlabuyalinga and Manguzi.This is in addition to a R90-million upgrade of the Manguzi Police Station. We are investing all the necessary resources to end the scourge of vehicle theft and all forms of crime in the area. We commend our police for the excellent work, Kaunda stressed.
