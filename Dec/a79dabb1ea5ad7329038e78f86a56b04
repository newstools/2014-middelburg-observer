Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa has again called for the African National Congress (ANC) to listen to the people or risk losing in the 2019 elections.Speaking to members and leadership of the ANC s Greater Midrand Zone 15 at the Ivory Park North Hall on Friday night, Ramaphosa said people boycotted the 2016 elections to teach the ruling party a lesson for wasting resources, stealing money and its corrupt manner, News24 has reported.He said it was time the ruling party reversed that and listened to the voters because he did not want the ANC to be punished anymore.At the moment, the ANC has lost its role as the leader in society, hence the likes of Reverend Frank Chikane spoke out against the ills in the party.Though some have criticised Chikane for speaking up, Ramaphosa said he was driven by his deep love for the ruling party.Ramaphosa has recently been vocal about the corruption within the ruling party, comments that have landed him into trouble with the ANC Youth League.In his speech at the Chris Hani Memorial Lecture last month, Ramaphosa slated President Jacob Zuma and the Guptas, further saying there were people who were buying votes ahead of the party s conference in December. These practices threaten the integrity of the state, undermine our economic progress and diminish our ability to change the lives of the poor. These activities, if left unchecked, could destroy the revolution, said Ramaphosa.He also addressed state capture allegations, saying they should be put to rest, further calling for the ruling party to establish an effective, credible mechanism to investigate the claims. Those that have evidence will be able to come forward. Those that have been unfairly implicated will have an opportunity to clear their names. Unless the ANC addresses these challenges, we can be certain that our electoral support will continue to slide. Caxton News ServiceRead original story on citizen.co.za
