A family of a missing 32-year-old female patient who vanished without a trace from Ngwelezana Hospital in KwaZulu-Natal three weeks ago is questioning the hospital s competence, Zululand Observer reports.Nomvula Gloria Sibiya, 32, from Buchanana Reserve apparently disappeared from the hospital a day after her admission.According to her brother, Thulani Sibiya, his mentally ill sister was admitted on a Friday three weeks ago, and when her family went to visit her the next day, they were told she had disappeared. No one phoned to tell us that she was missing. It was only when we came to visit the next day when they gave us the bad news. When we asked, no one had an explanation as to what happened, said Thulani. How can a patient disappear under the hospital s care? She was under their supervision, and they have no clue what happened. A missing person case has been opened with the police, and Thulani is now appealing to the public to assist the family in searching for his sister.Anyone with information can contact Thulani on 071 2648501.
