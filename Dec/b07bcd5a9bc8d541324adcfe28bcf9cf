Members of the South African Police Service (SAPS), Johannesburg Metro Police Department (JMPD) and the City’s Group Forensic and Investigation Service (GFIS) seized City Power infrastructure material worth R80-million during a joint operation on October 31. MMC for Environment and Infrastructure Services Nico de Jager said GFIS received a tip-off from a member of the public that City Power’s infrastructure material provided to the contractors and subcontractors for daily maintenance and major projects was not returned to City Power’s stores upon completion of projects. “As per the terms of the contract entered into by City Power and contractors, they were required to return the unused and replaced material upon completion of work,” he said. De Jager said 10 search warrants were obtained. GFIS, SAPS and the JMPD conducted operations at the 10 properties. “Some of the material recovered includes transformers, warning boards, overhead lines, street light fittings, fuses, circuit breakers, joint boxes, termination kits, street lights and street poles. “I was also informed that some of the material found its way to KwaZulu-Natal and Mpumalanga. Some of these contractors collude with officials from City Power and receive surplus material which they use for contracts outside Johannesburg. Contractors sabotage our economy and our city by stealing infrastructure.” De Jager thanked the law enforcement agencies who were involved in the operation.
