The police ministry has denied reports that Police Minister Fikile Mbalula has effectively assumed command and control of the police’s crime intelligence unit. This after EWN reported on Monday that last month Mbalula issued a ministerial directive to the unit to report to him on its operations, sidelining acting national police commissioner Lieutenant-General Lesetja Mothiba. The report has raised concerns about the minister’s instructions possibly being irregular and unlawful. Mbalula’s spokesperson, Vuyo Mhaga, said the minister was not trying to take control of crime intelligence as reported. “Not at all, except with the issues that I’m basically dealing with over how far are we to make sure that people who are in that unit are actually vetted, and that’s the centre of everything. “It’s got nothing to do with the operation. That remains the work of the police,” Mhaga told Talk Radio 702 on Monday morning. Meeting minutes and confidential information notes EWN has seen reveal that: Mhaga denied claims Mbalula was receiving intelligence briefings from the unit. “Not at all. Not in terms of the office operation, it can’t be. That remains the work of the police. “As of yesterday he was addressing the central committee of Popcru, and one of his messages was that police must remain professional and get out of politics,” he said. – Caxton News Service Read original story on citizen.co.za
