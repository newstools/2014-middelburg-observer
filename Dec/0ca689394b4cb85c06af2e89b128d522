An anti-substance abuse fighter has paid the ultimate price with his life after being fatally stabbed at the Old Drill Hall Skate Park in Johannesburg CBD, the City Buzz reports.His only crime was a polite request to a drug addict, well-known to him and his colleagues, to choose a secluded spot in which to inject himself with his favourite poison instead of injecting himself in front of the children the activist was taking care of on the corner of Twist and Delvers streets.Kabelo Refilwe Makwa, 31, better known to the young boys and girls and youthful and enthusiastic skaters and regular users of the facility as KB , had left his home that fateful day to do what he loved most helping vulnerable children stay away from drugs and other forms of mischief.According to Lucky Dlangalala, a colleague of KB, Makwa bled to death in front of the very children he so dearly loved. We wish we could get some counselling for them, said Dlangalala.KB provided the children with an opportunity to fight boredom with an activity they loved the most skating. Little did he know that on this fateful Saturday afternoon, his life would be cut short by none other than a user of the very substance he so desperately wanted to protect the children from.
