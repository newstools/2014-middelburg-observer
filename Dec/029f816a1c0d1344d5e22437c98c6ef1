Gauteng education MEC Panyaza Lesufi has welcomed the decision to fire a teacher at St John s College in Johannesburg on Friday after being found guilty of racism, reports The Citizen.The educator has left the school with immediate effect.A statement released by the department reads: The MEC had earlier on Friday, 28 July 2017 visited the school and held a meeting with School Management Team in which he expressed his disappointment and unhappiness following the decision to retain the teacher, even after he was found guilty following a disciplinary process. Gauteng education department head Edward Mosuwe, St John s College council chairperson Dr John Patricios and visiting bishop Reverend Steve Moreo were also present at the meeting.The geography teacher was found guilty of three charges: contravening the South African Council of Educator s (Sace) code of conduct, making racist and derogatory statements and for bringing the school into disrepute following an internal disciplinary hearing.But he was initially only given a final written warning, removed from senior positions he held at the institution and received a pay cut.Lesufi said during the visit to the school, the final written warning was unsatisfactory considering the seriousness of the charges and the charge of guilt against the teacher. All schools, whether they are public or private, cannot have codes of conduct that contravene the constitution of South Africa. We will deal with racism decisively and not give racists space to breath because nonracialism is nonnegotiable, the MEC said.The education department said a summit would be facilitated in September to deal in detail with all issues affecting private and independent schools in particular. The date for the summit will be announced in due course.Breaking News: We&#39;ve just received a report from St. John C that the teacher has left the employment of the school with immediate effect&mdash; Panyaza Lesufi (@Lesufi) July 28, 2017I hate racism with a passion but I am addicted to non racialism&mdash; Panyaza Lesufi (@Lesufi) July 28, 2017Some parents protested outside the school on Friday morning.Parents protest outside St John&#39;s College &#8211; MEC @Lesufi meeting SMT shortly @Steve_Mabona @LindaMpete57 pic.twitter.com/cDbTlUzf7g&mdash; Gauteng Education (@EducationGP) July 28, 2017MEC @Lesufi arriving at St John&#39;s College @Steve_Mabona pic.twitter.com/8VzEqpF0bG&mdash; Gauteng Education (@EducationGP) July 28, 2017 Caxton News ServiceRead original story on citizen.co.za
