Eden District Municipality disaster chief Gerhard Otto says he is optimistic that the firefighters have won the fight in the region, reports the Knysna-Plett Herald. I am positive that we will bring an end to the disaster today. Everything looks good and the fires are 90% contained. Otto says there are still fires with open flames in Plettenberg Bay, in Knysna behind Concordia and to the north-east of Sedgefield in the plantation. We constantly have 400 firefighters deployed while 400 sleep, and five helicopters are waterbombing the fires. There were 20 homes destroyed in Plettenberg Bay yesterday and six in Knysna. He could not say how many informal dwellings have been destroyed.He said none of the provisions will go to waste and he has asked that hampers be made up for distribution among the affected families. Many people are staying with friends and family and can contribute to the household in this way. We are grateful for everything, but ask that people now rather start making financial contributions as those who have lost everything need to start rebuilding their lives.&#8220;It s also better to give someone a shopping voucher that they can use to fufil their own specific needs. It s also more dignified. Mopping upGeorge Fire Brigade has withdrawn two teams from Knysna. They are joined today by a team of 10 firefighters from Pretoria and will focus on mopping up in the George area.Mopping up is the extinguishing or removing of burning material near control lines, felling snags, and trenching logs to prevent rolling after an area has burned, to make a fire safe, or to reduce residual smoke.
