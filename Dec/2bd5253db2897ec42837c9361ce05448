Naledi Phafane, 14, of Moreleta Park in Pretoria is set to change the tech game while empowering communities.Some might even argue the teen already has.Naledi s idea won her the Ekurhuleni Metropolitan Municipality Hackathon in 2016 at just 13 after she had caused a stir for being the youngest developer in the challenge.She won R100 000 which she used to develop her traffic mobile app www.openrobot.co.za. The mobile application reduces traffic congestion in big cities which are faced with a lot of traffic problems, explained Naledi.Watch a video here:Naledi said the app suggested alternative routes to help motorists avoid traffic jams.But as if that was not enough, the tech savvy teen has come up with a solution for South Africa s pressing need. We designed an app that will use cellphone [GPS] signals to confirm a person s residence, which could be used by banks and other companies as proof of residence documentation, she explained.The Pretoria east teenager founded her mobile Apps company Spectrum after a conversation with some buffs already in the tech space. I have always had interest in business which pushed me to enter business competitions, said Naledi.Late last year, Naledi entered another competition but though she didn t win, she was crowned Girl coder of the week for her brilliant idea.She went on to develop another app, www.lunchorder.co.za, which is said to being a favourite among working parents who got little time on their hands than to prepare lunch for their children.The app allows parents to order food and have it delivered to their children in school, according to the young developer. This was after discovering the low variety of food at school tuckshops, said Naledi while attending a mentoring session at Geekulcha s Vac-Work.The youth tech company provides a service through which it monitors the progression of its graduates who have entered the job market to help them make an easier transition.Naledi s passion for helping others has also seen her come up with another App, www.moval.co.za, to help students find accommodation safe in Sunnyside, Arcadia, Hatfield and in the city centre.The app also connects the students to moving companies, a project in which she teamed up with her father Pule who is also a mobile apps developer. I am very proud of my daughter for what she is doing for the communities she has identified to help, said Pule.In her spare time, Naledi volunteers by mentoring other young people who are in Vac-Work Soweto lab.On 1 and 2 April, Naledi will host a hackathon at The Fields in Hatfield, east of Pretoria.
