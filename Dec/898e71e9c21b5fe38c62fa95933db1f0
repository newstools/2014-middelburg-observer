Three people, both drivers and one passenger, were declared deceased and two unrestrained toddlers seated on their mothers laps sustained critical injuries and required advanced life support intervention, said IPSS spokesperson Paul Herbst. A further two people suffered moderate injuries and were taken to various medical facilities. The Doosberg road was closed for a period of time and has since been reopened.
