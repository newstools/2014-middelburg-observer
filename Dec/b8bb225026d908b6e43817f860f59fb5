Yet another house belonging to a farmer in the violence-stricken area of Coligny, in North West, was set alight on Monday morning.This comes after the two men accused of the murdering Matlhomola Mosweu were granted bail. The accused, Pieter Doorewaard and Phillip Schutte, said they apprehended the deceased, who they alleged stole sunflowers on one of the plantations.The court heard last week that the deceased jumped off the moving vehicle the accused were travelling in, a version disputed by one of the state s witnesses, who said one of the farmers pushed the deceased off the moving bakkie.Since Monday morning s court judgment, the area has been volatile, with locals threatening to burn down more houses.Meanwhile, at the house that was set alight, one farm owner threatened journalists with a firearm, saying he would shoot them if they did not leave.
