A student from Walter Sisulu University mistakenly received R14 million in her student debit account from The National Student Aid Scheme about five months ago.University spokesperson Yonela Tukwayo told TimesLive that some students picked up that the student had started living a very lavish lifestyle.The student has allegedly spent more than R800 000 thus far. It was very callous, and she did not report the matter immediately. She will definitely be held responsible, Tukwayo said. We will also be looking into how this money was spent to buy some of the expensive goods. Legal action will be taken against student who spent R818 000.00 of R14 million erroneously paid to her #NSFAS account. #sabcnews pic.twitter.com/9BthtZn9Na&mdash; Mweli Masilela (@mwelimasilela) August 30, 2017#ThingsICanDoWithR14MStart my own mobile network with REASONABLE data prices.&mdash; Sheldon Cameron (@Sheldon_Cameron) August 30, 2017If I was the one who got that R14 million &#8230;I&#39;d be moving to Zimbali tomorrow morning #NSFAS pic.twitter.com/hepMcYK3bk&mdash; Thobeka (@DrakeIsBae96) August 29, 2017Move to another continent immediately. #thingsicandowithr14m pic.twitter.com/2qCUIi0y8e&mdash; Lyanna Mormont (@luciaralepobe) August 30, 2017For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Read original story on
