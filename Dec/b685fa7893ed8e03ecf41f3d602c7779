Countless fish have gone belly-up, there s a booming mosquito population, and now, there is thought to be a fear of bilharzia in the beleaguered Mahlongwana River in Widenham, on KwaZulu-Natal s south coast, reports the South Coast Herald.The cause: water lettuce that has grown wildly out of control.Bilharzia, also known as snail fever and schistosomiasis, is a disease caused by parasitic flatworms.Strangely though, this would suggest that the river was contaminated with raw, untreated sewage that had spilled into the river, causing the growth of the water lettuce.The bilharzia infection cycle begins when freshwater becomes infected with the eggs of parasites through the faeces and/or urine of infected humans.The eggs, when released into a water source, hatch, and worms reproduce inside the water snails tiny larvae are then released into the water and can survive for up to two full days.According to the Clansthal Conservancy, the water is yet to be tested to determine whether or not bilharzia is indeed present. However, locals were advised not to enter the water at all.Symptoms may include abdominal pain, diarrhoea, bloody stool or blood in urine.Upon investigation near the beach, it was found that multiple dead fish identified as mullet had floated downstream and various birds were enjoying the feast.A concerned local who was present explained that the birds eating the fish were also a concern, as the fish might be infected, and this could result in the birds dying.It was feared that the birds could possibly also spread disease.Meanwhile, the recently-released weevils were apparently doing the trick in slowly eating away at the water lettuce, and the Clansthal Conservancy said that results should be visible within the coming weeks.Chief executive officer of Conservation KZN Rob Crankshaw stated: Special research has been undertaken by the Agriculture Research Council to ensure that the weevils Neohydronomous affinis will not also attack local South African plants. Optimistically, Crankshaw added: The weevils have been introduced to the upper reaches of the river with good results, one area is already clear. On Friday, we introduced more weevils to the main lagoon area of the river, and results should be seen within a few weeks. The weevil has not been introduced in rivers so close to the sea before, so we are hoping for the best. The department of water and sanitation is yet to comment on the matter.
