With increasing calls for the ANC’s new leadership to recall President Jacob Zuma from office, the governing party’s stalwarts and veterans are reportedly demanding that the party’s integrity committee to be given new powers to take independent decisions and force leaders to step down for bringing the party into disrepute. This after Zuma snubbed a request by the committee last year to resign for bringing the ANC into disrepute. According to The Sowetan, ANC stalwart Wally Serote on Monday called on the newly elected national executive committee (NEC) of the ANC to use its first meeting in East London on Wednesday to give the integrity committee more teeth. The committee is chaired by former Rivonia trialist Andrew Mlangeni. “This should ensure [that] the original intentions of the NEC’s 2013 decision to hold leadership accountable and that the integrity of the ANC is not compromised, finally become reality,” Serote said. Serote warned that the ANC could be punished at the polls in 2019 for failing to deal with the paralysis within the party, government and the economy. However, given that the ANC’s 54th national conference in December could not reach an agreement on giving the integrity committee more powers, it is unlikely the NEC would take a different decision on the matter. – Caxton News Service  For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
