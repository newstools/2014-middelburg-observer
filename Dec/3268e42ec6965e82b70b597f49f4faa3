After 17 years in the office, Durban s Ramini Naidoo is ready to set off on a 120km journey on foot with a few of her colleagues to raise environmental awareness, reports the Berea Mail.Starting at sunrise on Monday, 8 May, she plans to walk from Gansbaai through Kleinmond, Gordons Bay, Muizenberg until she reaches the Boulders Beach penguin colony in Simon&#8217;s Town on 14 May.Since joining the South African Association for Marine Biological Research (SAAMBR) in 2001, Ramini has supported the work of both the Oceanographic Research Institute (ORI) scientists and uShaka Sea World educators who work hand in hand investigating and disseminating information.Now it is her turn to go out into the field and share her love and commitment to the marine environment by walking an average of 20 kilometers a day for six consecutive days. Working with the scientists and educators has really inspired me in so many ways. Being a part of their everyday activities I ve learnt so much and have been so inspired working with these amazing passionate people and am proud to be part of marine conservation in South Africa, said Ramini.She said although she was a little nervous as she wondered whether she would be able to keep up with the younger members on the team, her two children Schanice and Bevan reminded her that she was indeed both mentally and physically capable of achieving whatever she set out to do.We are officially on the road! Give a hoot for @penguinpromises #Waddle2017! @saambr @apssZA @OldMutualSA pic.twitter.com/31xRmTiRJK&mdash; Two Oceans Aquarium (@2OceansAquarium) May 8, 2017 I have been preparing for the walk which my colleague assured me is no more than 240 000 steps by walking along the promenade in the evenings, line dancing and occasionally jogging. Along the route we plan to visit a number of primary schools, penguin colonies, environmental organizations and inspire both the locals and visitors we meet along our journey. I hope to encourage them through the Penguin Promises campaign to embrace environmentally sustainable lifestyle choices, said Ramini.Ramini said by simply taking small steps towards living with the planet in mind, we quickly grow into the habit of doing the right thing. I always say no thank you to plastic straws, take my own reusable bag to the supermarket, reduce my electricity consumption and try wherever I can to reduce the amount of water I use, she said.Lowering our carbon footprint is not only good for penguins but good for people as well.
