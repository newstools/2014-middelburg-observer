After a protracted race for the leadership of the ANC – and ultimately the country – South Africans will finally find out today who takes over the reins from President Jacob Zuma: Cyril Ramaphosa or Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma. The smart money seems to be on Ramaphosa – and that’s according to the bookies. According to an online betting website at the start of the ANC’s elective conference on Saturday, the deputy president’s odds of winning were 1.75 to one, while Dlamini-Zuma had odds of 3.2 to one. A long shot was ANC treasurer-general Zweli Mkhize, whose odds stood at 6.5 to one. While other bookies gave the two frontrunners slightly different odds, Ramaphosa remained the firm favourite. Not everyone seems to agree though. Supra Mahumapelo, North West ANC chairperson, yesterday said he was still confident Dlamini-Zuma would clinch victory. Mahumapelo was adamant some Ramaphosa delegates were switching camps and others, who earlier supported candidates such as Mathews Phosa, were also crossing to the NDZ camp. He could make a few bob if he’s right. – Caxton News Service  For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter. Read original story on citizen.co.za
