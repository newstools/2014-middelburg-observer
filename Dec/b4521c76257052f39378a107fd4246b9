Announcing the results of the motion of no confidence against President Jacob Zuma in parliament on Tuesday, Speaker Baleka Mbete said that of 384 total votes there were 177 yes votes, 198 no votes and nine abstentions, meaning Zuma would remain president, reports The Citizen.The difference was a mere 11 votes. The motion of no confidence in the president is accordingly negative, Mbete said. That concluded the business for the day. The rand immediately tanked at the news.The results were closer than many expected and could only have been attained if a number of ANC MPs actually supported the motion.At least 18 of the ruling party s members voted with the opposition, who had taken pains to portray their motion as an attempt to dislodge a weak and unpopular president, not an assault on the ruling ANC.There were scenes of wild jubilation from the ANC benches and shocked despair beside them from the opposition as Zuma survived his eighth no-confidence motion in eight years after weeks of protest and even Constitutional Court action in an effort to depose him.With 400 seats in the house of which five were vacant, Speaker Baleka Mbete ruled a majority vote of 201 was needed for the motion to carry. I never imagined that one day I would be here, in this parliament, fighting a new form of oppression a corrupt system that keeps our people imprisoned in poverty, DA leader Mmusi Maimane said. If you had told me that one day our democratically elected president would end up corrupted and captured by a criminal syndicate, I would ve never believed you. But here we are. We may have travelled along different roads, but we have arrived at the same destination. We all have a chance today to do what is right, what is just and what is honourable, Maimane said ultimately in vain.Despite Mbete saying on Monday there was no legal basis for her to recuse herself, it was left to Lechesa Tsenoli to run the sometimes rowdy house for the main part.EFF leader Julius Malema came close to being thrown out of Parliament after he called Zuma a criminal.When called to withdraw his comments or be expelled, Malema said he would withdraw the comments because he wanted to vote the crook out. At 6.40pm, parliament s secret ballot was counted and announced.ANC chief whip Jackson Mthembu said the most important thing had been to defeat the motion but they would now concentrate on unifying the party again.He told reporters, however, that: Right now, I m going home. I m tired.
