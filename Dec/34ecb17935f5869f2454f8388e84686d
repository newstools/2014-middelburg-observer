Following a video that went viral on social media in September, where an EMPD officer can be seen allegedly assaulting a woman at a Primrose intersection in Germiston, the woman’s advocate, Leana Fick, and candidate attorney Andrew Howie appeared in the Germiston Magistrates’ Court on Tuesday, Germiston City News reports. Howie said his client had criminal charges against her withdrawn due to a lack of evidence. “She is relieved that she can now move on with life and put this aspect of the matter behind her,” he said. “She is going to exercise her right to proceed with criminal charges and a civil claim against those that are implicated in the matter.” The incident took place in September on the corner of Cactus Road and Ceres Street. In the video, it seems the officers pulled the woman over, and an argument ensued.  The woman can be heard repeatedly shouting: “Who touched you?” before the officer puts down a file she was holding and starts assaulting the woman. According to EMPD spokesperson Wilfred Kgasago, the altercation started after the woman refused to give the officers her details after being pulled over. “The officer claims a woman attacked her first before the video was captured … she opened a case of assault, and the woman lay a counter charge in the same police station the following day.” For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
