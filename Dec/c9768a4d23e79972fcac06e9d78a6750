Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi confirmed an outbreak of Listeria with over 500 reports across the country. Of the 70 cases confirmed by the laboratory, 36 had already died, he said. Animal products and fresh produce such as fruits and vegetables can be contaminated from these sources. Although anyone can get Listeriosis, those at high risk of developing severe disease include newborns, the elderly, pregnant women,  persons with weak immunity such as HIV, Diabetes, Cancer, Chronic liver or Kidney disease. Motsoaledi says the department believes the source of the outbreak most likely be contaminated food sources such as farms and agriculture or food processing plants. “The source of this outbreak is currently being investigated, and all the stakeholders are cooperating with the investigation led by the NICD. Environmental Health Officers are following up diagnosed cases and are visiting their homes to sample food where available,” he said.    Read original story on reviewonline.co.za
