A Glen Anil resident in Durban North fears his rose garden, worth about R20 000, could be destroyed, the Northglen News reports.James Easton, who lives on Mvule Road, said he was concerned the placing of fibre-optic cables in the area would end up destroying his rose garden on his verge, which he began planting in March.What s more, the 27-year-old said the digging up of the verge would also affect his sprinkler system, which harvests rainwater. Easton has three rows of about 800 roses planted on his verge. I began planting in March for the winter season because some of the roses bloom during the colder months. At the time when I started this I didn t realise there was any sort of work going to be taking place. I ve spent around R20 000 to help beautify the verge. It has been a labour of love, but I m concerned that all my hard work is about to be undone. I know the City own the verges, but if the cable-laying company gives me the option, I would rather not have any fibre and keep my garden, he said.Easton said if he failed to stop the cable laying, he would ask the City if he could adopt his verge.However, the City-run Adopt-A-Spot programme, which was initiated in 1997, has started to deal with the problem of littering and illegal dumping on public sites. It does not specify if that involves verges. Caxton News ServiceRead original story on northglennews.co.za
