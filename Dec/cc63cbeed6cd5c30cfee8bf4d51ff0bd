Three senior employees have been fired by the national Olympic committee, including chief executive Tubby Reddy. The SA Sports Confederation and Olympic Committee (Sascoc) confirmed on Tuesday it had also sacked chief financial officer Vinesh Maharaj and Jean Kelly, a senior manager in Reddy’s office, following a lengthy disciplinary process. “Letters of dismissal were sent to them yesterday,” Sascoc vice-president Barry Hendricks revealed. “They can appeal through the CCMA, which was confirmed to them in their letters.” The reasons for dismissal were expected to be revealed in a media release later on Tuesday. Reddy was suspended on full pay in July last year, on various charges including sexual harassment. His hearing was expected to be completed within a few weeks, but multiple costly postponements and delays dragged the process out for six months. In a statement, Reddy’s legal team said he rejected the outcome of what he claimed was a “one-sided” disciplinary hearing, after the panel recommended to the board that all three staffers be dismissed. Reddy insisted he was ill and did not appear before the disciplinary committee, which refused to delay the process further. He claimed due process had not been followed, a majority decision was not taken by the Sascoc board, and that Sascoc has “squandered” R3 million in legal fees throughout the process. “Mr Reddy will be appealing this flawed process through the normal channels available to him,” his lawyer Vasavan Samuel said in a statement.
