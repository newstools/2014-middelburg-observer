Police spokesperson Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said the incident happened on Friday at about 9am when the farmer, one of the labourers on his farm, and a 30-year-old Zimbabwean were looking for a buffalo that had escaped from the farm. “What appears to be a freak accident, the Zimbabwean, allegedly shot himself while tracking down the buffalo,” Mojapelo. “He immediately started shivering and was rushed to a hospital in Polokwane, where he later died at about 12pm, apparently due to the effect of the animal-darting substance. The matter was then reported at Polokwane Police Station.” The police investigation into the shooting was continuing. Mojapelo said: “Legal gun owners are once again warned to always adhere to laws governing the handling of firearms, as the police will not hesitate to take strong actions against noncompliance.” – Caxton News Service Read original story on citizen.co.za
