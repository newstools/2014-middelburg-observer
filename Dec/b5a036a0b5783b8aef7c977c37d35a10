A natural ecosystem full of beautiful bird and aquatic life which attracts surrounding fishermen to join in on fishing competitions at the dam at Rusty Hook a country restaurant in Wilgespruit will soon be something of the past due to chemical waste flooding the property, the Roodepoort Northsider reports.The distraught owner, James Oosthuizen, who has been running the restaurant for the past 14 years, said he was attracted by the peacefulness of the dam to start a business.However, the industrial companies above his property have spoilt the progress of his business. With the industrial area above us, we have companies who dump chemicals into the stormwater system. So every time they dump, it goes to the wetland above us, and, when it rains, chemicals get flushed into our dam, causing fish and other aquatic life and birds to suffer the consequences, Oosthuizen explained.The property is situated beneath companies that produce various toxic products such as cleaning substances and paint.According to the owner, when it pours, a white foam develops, which flushes into the dam, and it then dissolves after the rain has stopped.Oosthuizen said that many fish had been killed and the matter was reported several times to the relevant authorities. We have repeatedly reported this problem to the authorities, but to no avail, he said, adding that the local councillor of Ward 97, Leah Knott, was made aware of the matter. l sent the complaint to environmental health straight away and an inspection has been allocated to investigate and provide a solution, Knott said.In the interim, Oosthuizen said, he had a meeting in good faith with the companies involved and they are trying to resolve the issue.
