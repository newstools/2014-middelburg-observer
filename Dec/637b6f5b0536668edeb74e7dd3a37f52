Minister of Social Development Bathabile Dlamini has reassured all qualifying beneficiaries that they will receive their money as per normal, the Brakpan Herald reports.As recipients of social grants are aware, payments are made at various channels including merchants, points of sale, banks, ATMs and Sassa pay points.Considering that April 1 is a Saturday and for this reason, as in all occasions when the grant payment date falls over a weekend, Sassa pay points will not open.Special focus and provision will be made for the busiest merchants and ATMs around the country and regional executive managers will be deployed to monitor and assist beneficiaries with enquiries.On April 3, Sassa pay points will operate as normal and recipients are encouraged to go on their respective days and respective pay points as indicated on the slips they received last month.Teams of managers will also be deployed to provide assistance at the pay points.Measures in place as of April 1: The Sassa call centre will be opened to assist beneficiaries with all enquiries.The contact number is 0800 60 10 11. Senior officials will be deployed at the call centre to make sure that all enquiries are attended to. Officials will also be on standby to receive calls that may come through the switchboard. Arrangements have been made to ensure that SOCPEN (a national interface system that coordinated with the provincial government to provide social grants to beneficiaries) is available for investigation and verification of the status of the grants applications A letter to the national police commissioner has been sent out for a request to increase police visibility across the country.The department emphasised that normal business processes will continue, so any form of lapsing or suspensions that may occur may not imply a failure to pay by Sassa.
