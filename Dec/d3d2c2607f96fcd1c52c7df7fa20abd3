Phase 1 of the Bunny Park s revamp will be concluded at the end of June, reports the Benoni City Times.According to Themba Gadebe, Ekurhuleni metro spokesperson, the second phase will commence on July 1 and last until the end of June next year.The facility will remain closed to the public until at least the end of Phase Two. About R8 million has been set aside for the second phase of revamping of the park, Gadebe said. This will include the upgrading of the gazebos, installation of playground equipment, upgrade of the bunny shelters and installation of new park furniture. Work in the park during the second phase will also include construction of mini-bridges, a new pump house, fencing around the animal shelters and the addition of gabions. The estimated cost of Phase One was R3.7 million.It was focused on dredging two of the park s three dams and connecting them through canals, to ensure the water doesn t become stagnant.Gadebe said after the construction period, vegetation will be planted and allowed to grow before any animals are brought back to the park.The material dredged from the dams will be used as a natural fertiliser for the vegetation.The cows, sheep, goats, some birds and one pig were moved to temporary foster homes by mid-May, where they will remain for the duration of the revamp.
