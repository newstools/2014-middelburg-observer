Lucky Sefali, 28, a loving dad to his five-year-old son, was one of the two men who were killed in Pinetown, KwaZulu-Natal, on Monday afternoon, Highway Mail reports .His family said it was still hard to accept that Lucky, a humble soul, was killed in such a brutal manner.His distraught nephew, Malusi Zangwa said they got worried when his uncle did not return home. My uncle had the same routine, although he had his own house nearby. He would always start at my home and have supper and then we would watch TV together. In the morning, he would pass by the house before going to work. Malusi said they were aware of the Pinetown mob attack, but they did not want to consider that he could be one of the two men when he did not return home. There were videos going around, but we heard that the two men were foreigners. Yesterday, my mom said we should check at the mortuary as some people who knew about his disappearance mentioned that one of the two men that were beaten in Pinetown resembled Lucky. When we went to the mortuary, my uncle had a huge hole in his forehead and was missing all his teeth, said an emotional Malusi.Malusi said they spoke to the child s father who told them that Lucky was coming from work when he tried to stop the mob from attacking Mlungisi, who was also killed during the incident. Lucky was a people s person and I believe that he knew Mlungisi and that was the reason he tried to intervene when he saw people attacking him and accusing him of being a kidnapper and a foreigner. Mlungisi Nxumalo, 44, was from KwaNdengezi, and Lucky lived in Klaarwater.Police have opened a case of double murder, and are still investigating.
