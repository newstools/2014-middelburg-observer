Photos of a prison warden kissing an inmate have caused an uproar on social media. In the photos, a female prison warden from Losperfontein Correctional Service Centre in Brits, North West, is seen in uniform kissing and hugging a male prisoner. It was unclear where the photos were taken. Correctional services spokesperson Singabakho Nxumalo said the department was aware of the photos and investigating the matter. Unfortunately, the warder reportedly committed suicide following the leaked images.    “The department of correctional services [DCS] has been made aware of images involving an official and inmate, from Losperfontein Correctional Centre, in an intimate position circulating on social media. “As this is disturbing and strictly prohibited, the department condemns this type of behaviour in the strongest possible terms. “While DCS was busy investigating this matter, we have since learned with shock that the official allegedly appearing on the images has committed suicide,” Nxumalo told eNCA. – Caxton News Service   Read original story on citizen.co.za
