For the last four months, Durban s ward 110 councillor, Pete Graham, has been trying to get the eThekwini Traffic Authority to fix their mistake, reports the Northglen News.The City recently installed four speed humps on Glen Anil Street, but just after the installation, it was revealed they had been put in the wrong place.According to Graham, the humps were meant for the residential section higher up the road. The one-week project cost the City R81 000. They were meant for higher up the road, that s where the speeding occurs. I ve had several residents complain they ve almost been taken out by people speeding down the hill. What I can t understand is just before the installation, we had a site meeting with the contractor, and there was a plan about where the humps should go. When I realised they had put them in the wrong place it was too late. I contacted the ETA who sent out an inspector and confirmed they were in the wrong place. I was told the City don t have the budget to move them, and I would have to use my blocksum if I wanted additional speed humps which were meant for higher up the road anyway, said a perplexed Graham.He added if residents were to ask for more speed humps, it would be a minimum wait of two years. The City have told me they won t be removing them, and there s nothing that can be done. This is wasteful expenditure which the Mayor said we as a City had taken a stance against, he said.eThekwini spokesperson Tozi Mthethwa said the City was aware of the mistake and that two additional speed humps were required on the road. At the last meeting held it was agreed that the additional speed humps will be budgeted for in the 2018/19 financial year. There is no action required against the contractor. This is not a wasteful expenditure because the existing speed humps are assisting in regulating speeds along the road. The humps will remain as they are serving the purpose, she said.
