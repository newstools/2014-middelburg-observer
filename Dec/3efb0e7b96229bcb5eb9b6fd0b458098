Fourways motorists have expressed their frustration as large-scale roadworks commenced on Cedar Road last week, reports the Fourways Review.Lanes were closed on Cedar, Uranium and Witkoppen roads as construction began on May 3, leading to intense congestion and rush-hour delays for motorists.Cedar Road, between the junction of Uranium and Lombardy roads, is being resurfaced and widened to better handle the level of traffic in the area, and the intersection of Cedar and Witkoppen roads is also being resurfaced.There are also plans to create a new flyover for Witkoppen Road, although details on this project are scarce.The intersection of Cedar and Witkoppen Roads is a nightmare to negotiate since construction began.The restricted movement on the roads has seen motorists forced to use only a single lane in either direction on Cedar Road for most of the week starting on 1 May, and this has caused high levels of exasperation among the people who live in the area, as seen on social media. It is understandable that these roadworks are necessary and, in my opinion, long overdue, and I believe most people feel the same, said the Facebook user, Stephanie Wright. However, [residents&#8217;] gripe here is that there are too many projects happening at the same time, and closing a main road during the week is madness! Although there have been OUTsurance pointsmen in the area, which help to control traffic over the several days following the beginning of construction, they have not been able to stop vehicle build-up.Some residents also feel that more pointsmen are needed at every intersection affected by development.Multiple lanes on Cedar Road are closed for resurfacing.
