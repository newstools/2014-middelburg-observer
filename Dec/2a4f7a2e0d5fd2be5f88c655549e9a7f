The boy who was bitten by the family dog at their home in Burgershoop, on the West Rand, on Saturday, June 24, has received multiple donations from various kindhearted residents, the Krugersdorp News reports.Seunn Jonker, a nine-year-old boy, was in his backyard with his parents when an argument between the two adults took place. The family dog, Chico, became aggressive, and when Seunn walked past it, it grabbed him by his calf.The dog s jaws allegedly locked onto his leg, ripping the muscle from the bone. Seunn s father took a piece of wire and tied it around the dog s neck to force it to let go of the child s leg. Eventually the dog let go, and the boy s leg was freed.After the incident, his father continued to strangle the dog, allegedly because it remained aggressive.The boy was rushed to Dr Yusuf Dadoo Hospital and was treated in the emergency room. He was then transferred to Leratong Hospital for further crucial care.Since the incident, Child Medi Organisation (CMO), a nonprofit organisation that focuses on providing funding for children with emergency medical situations, has posted very graphic pictures of the boy s leg and asked residents to donate funds to help save it.An anonymous donor contacted CMO and said he would pay the hospital fees if the child was transferred to a private hospital. A donation of R68 000 has since been received by CMO and the boy has been transferred to the Life Robinson Hospital today, 29 June.The donor is said to have two children and states he did not even think twice about helping a child in need. My husband is just someone with an awesome heart. I believe God just calls you to help someone, and when we saw the post of the child on Facebook, He called us, said his wife.CMO will not pay the money to the parents. Instead they pay the doctors, to ensure that it is put to good use. Although a large amount of money has been paid towards the boy s hospital admission and his surgery, the anaesthetist, specialists and extra days in hospital still need to be paid for.The organisation is asking anyone who is willing to make a donation to contact Amor on 062 266 0486 or Nadia on 063 507 5384, or make anonymous donation to:Child Medi Organisation, Bank: FNB Cheque account no: 626 325 810 56 Branch Code: 250655, Swift code: firnzajj Ref: Seunn Caxton News ServiceRead original story on krugersdorpnews.co.za
