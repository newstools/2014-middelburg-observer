Durban&#8217;s homeless are to be assisted by a new social development strategy agreed to by council that will see the development of shelters and drop-in centres to reduce street begging, drug abuse and crime in the city, reports the Berea Mail.eThekwini council gave its support to the recommendations contained in a report from the Safety and Emergency Services Committee at a full meeting of council this week. It agreed to embark on an holistic approach to assist those living on the streets of Durban.The report outlined the adoption of a Social Developmental Strategy and the implementation of recommendations emanating from an in-depth homeless study conducted in the City. These recommendations include drop-in centres, shelters as well as policy development to address these social ills.The committee noted that although the city had implemented intervention programmes such as the Qalakabusha Social Intervention programme which was initiated in 2014 to tackle homelessness and drug abuse within the inner City, more could be done.It said the development of an integrated social development strategy would take into account different stakeholders which included Safer Cities, Area Based Management, Human Settlements, Health, Metro Police and the Parks, Recreation and the Culture Unit.The financial implications of the implementation of the Social Developmental Plan will be provided separately for each intervention and be submitted to the Community Services Committee once the strategy has been adopted by Council.
