Hippos often leave the safety of the water when food is scarce and they then feed far from the relative safety of the water. They willl attack anything standing in their way to the safety of the water which is either a river or a dam.This hippo quickly became agitated with 2 tourists on safari in South Africa s Kruger National Park, as they positioned themselves for a better photograph (hippos are rarely seen this close outside of the water), the hippo decided to attack their car.They are remarkably fast and with powerful jaws can easily open up a car s protective metal like a can of beans .The tourists stayed calm under this extraordinary circumstance (maybe just one hysterical giggle) and got the sighting of a lifetime. Lucky escape for the Tourists. Caxton News ServiceRead original story on lowvelder.co.za
