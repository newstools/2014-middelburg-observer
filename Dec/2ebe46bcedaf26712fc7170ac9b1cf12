Johannesburg mayor Herman Mashaba said he expected the DA s federal executive to take tough action against Western Cape premier Helen Zille.The former DA leader will appear before the party s federal legal commission on Saturday for her tweets in which she said that colonialism s legacy was not all bad. For those claiming legacy of colonialism was ONLY negative, think of our independent judiciary, transport infrastructure, piped water, said Zille, further asking: Would we have had a transition into specialised health care and medication without colonial influence? Just be honest, please. Zille later apologised for a tweet that may have come across as a defence of colonialism. It was not. Mashaba told the Mail &amp; Guardian that leaders who praise this travesty will be dealt with accordingly and decisively .However, new acting Western Cape leader Bonginkosi Madikizela came to Zille s defence, telling the paper it was the public s perception of Zille s comments that was an issue, and not the comments she made.Just after Zille dished out her tweets on colonialism, DA leader Mmusi Maimane came out and said Let s make this clear: Colonialism, like Apartheid, was a system of oppression and subjugation. It can never be justified, a tweet Zille retweeted.DA national spokesperson Phumzile van Damme also came out to condemn Zille s tweet, saying: Colonialism was a crime against humanity. There isn t a single aspect of it that can be said to be positive or beneficial to Africans. -Caxton News ServiceRead original story on citizen.co.za
