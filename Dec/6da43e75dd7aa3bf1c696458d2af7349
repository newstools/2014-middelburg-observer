Following a ruling by the Constitutional Court on Thursday that a vote of no confidence in President Jacob Zuma can be conducted through a secret ballot, the Democratic Alliance (DA) has written to National Assembly speaker Baleka Mbete requesting her to schedule the debate at the earliest available opportunity, reports The Citizen.DA leader Mmusi Maimane called on members of parliament, particularly the ANC, to support the DA-sponsored motion, and said his party would remove Zuma from office, after the ConCourt ruled that Mbete had the final say on whether MPs would vote by way of a secret ballot. The motion of no confidence in President Zuma is a pivotal moment for our country and its future. Jacob Zuma has abandoned the interests of the people, the economy, and South Africa, in favour of a kleptocratic Guptamocracy. We cannot allow this to continue any longer. For the sake of the country, it is important that members of parliament, regardless of political affiliation, come together and put South Africa first by voting to protect the constitution and to end corruption. Public representatives in parliament are accountable to the people, first and foremost, Maimane said in a statement.Maimane said the removal of Zuma is the first step in stopping the ANC that is destroying our country and its future .
