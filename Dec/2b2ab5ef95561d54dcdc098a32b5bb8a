The Supreme Court of Appeal has ordered the parties involved in a court battle on whether the Henri van Breda trial should be broadcast live to liaise with one another in a bid to find a suitable date for the appeal to be heard.This is according to a report by EWN, which stated that if no consensus was reached, the president of the court would then need to determine the date.Van Breda faces three counts of murder, one of attempted murder, as well as defeating the ends of justice. He is currently out on bail of R100 000.The trial will resume on Tuesday and the Supreme Court of Appeal reportedly granted Van Breda and the National Director of Public Prosecutions leave to appeal a ruling by the high court, which granted permission to Media24 to live-broadcast the trial.It was previously reported by the the African News Agency that the Western Cape High Court Judge Siraj Desai ordered a suspension of his earlier ruling that said Media24 could broadcast the proceedings live during the trial.Earlier in April, the African News Agency reported that the Constitutional Court refused to hear Van Breda s leave to appeal the decision granting Media24 permission to broadcast the trial live, reportedly saying it was not in the interest of justice.
