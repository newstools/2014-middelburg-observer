Another teacher has died, bringing the death toll in the mass shooting on Tuesday to seven killed in the taxi (six teachers and the taxi driver) and a further five who were killed in the ambushed bakkie carrying the Klipriver Taxi Association deputy chairman. With the total now standing at 12 dead, calls are being made for police to act decisively. Road traffic police impounded 64 taxis on Wednesday in a massive operation undertaken by both local and provincial officers. Unroadworthy vehicles, along with vehicles without permits, were impounded in the massive crackdown. Among the 12 people who were killed in Tuesday morning’s (October 31) brutal ambush on the N11 were a taxi boss, Klipriver Taxi Association deputy chairperson 68-year-old Mr Muzikayifani Ngobese, and his 38-year old daughter, Nozipo Ngobese. At around 7am, gunmen who were waiting in the bushes at the top of a steep hill along the Matiwaneskop (Collings Pass) road opened fire as a Nissan bakkie approached. The shooters riddled the vehicle with bullets. The driver or an occupant of the bakkie, however, had enough control to keep the vehicle on the road for close to 100 metres before colliding at full speed with an oncoming taxi in its lane. The taxi was filled with teachers en-route to a nearby school. Four of them were killed instantly, with another two teachers dying later in hospital. The driver of the taxi was killed outright.
