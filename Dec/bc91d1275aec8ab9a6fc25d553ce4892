A truck transporting washing powder was looted after the vehicle caught fire in Ekurhuleni, Kempton Express reports. Video footage taken by Dean Finlayson shows the burning articulated vehicle parked on the R21 near Kaalfontein. With smoke pouring from the back trailer, one can see scores of people running through the slow-moving traffic to get their share of the spoils.  Vehicles were parked next to the road with the drivers also jumping out to help themselves. A man driving a DSV company vehicle can be seen first locking his company’s bakkie before sprinting towards the burning truck.
