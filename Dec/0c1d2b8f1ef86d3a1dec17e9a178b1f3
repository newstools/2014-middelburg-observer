TWO people were killed this morning on the new Dumisani Makhaye Drive freeway just outside Clermont. The road which cost R1.3 billion was opened by President Jacob Zuma recently. According to Garrith Jamieson from Rescue Care Paramedics, paramedics were called on scene around 4am and found that the driver had somehow lost control which caused the vehicle to come to rest on its roof in a ditch on the roadside. “Paramedics assessed the scene and found that there were seven occupants in the vehicle at the time of the collision. Unfortunately a man and a woman believed to be in their 30s suffered major injuries and there was nothing more that could be done for them and they were declared deceased at the scene,” said Jamieson. The other five occupants sustained various injuries and were stabilised on scene before transported to various Durban hospitals.   At this stage the events leading up to the single vehicle crash is unknown. SAPS were on scene and will be investigating further. Read original story on highwaymail.co.za
