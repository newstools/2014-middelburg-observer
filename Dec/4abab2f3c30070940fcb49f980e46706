Stormers captain and Springbok stalwart Siya Kolisi believes talk (and criticism) over the national team’s performances over the past two years could be a bit more constructive. Coach Allister Coetzee is currently fighting for his job as the South African Rugby Union (Saru) this week take stock on the Boks’ slump. Their win percentage for 2016 and 2017 is a measly 44% (11 wins out of 25). As a result, a frustrated rugby public hasn’t held back and want Coetzee booted out But Kolisi, one of few players to perform reasonably consistently this season, is adamant such attitudes are rash. “It hurts a lot to hear people saying the things they say about this team,” the 26-year-old flanker told World Rugby. “They don’t know what’s happening.” Much like Coetzee and the rest of his coaching staff, Kolisi highlights the spirit in the camp. It’s been a theme used throughout the year but it has been pointed out that it’s perhaps papering over poor results. “Luckily, we have each other,” said Kolisi. “We don’t walk onto the field wanting to lose. We want to make ourselves proud and South Africa. We play for the people who support us whether we lose or not, the people who back us. “It’s never nice to lose in a Springbok jersey and it never will be. I believe strongly in this group. All we’ve got to do is keep on working hard and wanting to improve everyday.” His measured comments will, possibly, bolster the case for him to be considered a leader in the national team. Some observers believe Coetzee missed a trick by not installing Kolisi as the stand-in captain when Warren Whiteley got injured in mid-year. Kolisi deputised for Eben Etzebeth in the second half of the Test against Wales in Cardiff and seemed to relish the opportunity, lifting his own game in the process.
