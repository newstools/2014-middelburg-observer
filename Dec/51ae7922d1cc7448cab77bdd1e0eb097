2018 claimed its first celebrity breakup this week, and it’s one that nobody saw coming. Khanyi Mbau and Tebogo Lerole, who have been dating for over eight years have gone their separate ways. The two lovers looked to be going strong towards the end of 2017. However, it seems as if there were problems behind the scenes because just 10 days into the new year, Khanyi took to Instagram to confirm that they had split. Part of her emotional statement read: “Today.. I made peace with a battle that I have lost, i have accepted defeat. My greatest fear and my greatest loss.. letting go of the man I gave my heart too @edwardbillion it has taken so much from me in convincing my self that I am OKAY (sic)”. Tebogo Lerole has yet to speak on the matter, but judging by the tone in Khanyi’s long Instagram caption, it’s safe to say that their relationship has ended for good. The television presenter sounded heartbroken, but revealed that she is now determined to love herself before trying to love anybody else. “I am afraid, I am so afraid but I am going to learn how to love me genuinely first before I try and love again. Lord give me strength.” Read the full post below: https://www.instagram.com/p/BdvLBbZhuO5/ Khanyi Mbau now joins other high-profile stars such as Bonang Matheba, Thembi Seete and Unathi Msengana in the celebrity singles club.
