Supplies are streaming in from all over the country to Knysna where raging fires have left a lot of residents destitute and in need, reports the Knysna-Plett Herald.At a major distribution centre, the basement of the Knysna municipality s technical services building in Spring Street, a team of dedicated volunteers and municipal employees are sorting through mountains of clothing, food, blankets and the like for residents in need.According to a municipal employee on the scene, mattresses, blankets, clothing, nonperishable food, utensils, and any available water are still in short supply.Because this specific centre is currently working at close to full capacity, big trucks or vehicles that are transporting donations and supplies are asked to drop the items off behind the Knysna Mall at the municipal base for disaster supplies.From this point and many others around Knysna, supplies are distributed to where they are needed.Please note that this is a distribution centre only.
