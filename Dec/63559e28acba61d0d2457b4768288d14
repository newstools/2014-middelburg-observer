The SABC s interim board has rescinded a decision made by the public broadcaster s previous board to take former public protector Thuli Madonsela s 2014 report into the affairs of the broadcaster on review.The board s chairperson Khanyisile Kweyama told MPs in Parliament on Wednesday morning they had withdrawn the application to the South Gauteng High Court.Kweyama said the interim board noted that the report titled When Governance and Ethics Fail might involve some labour laws that affect former SABC chief operating officer Hlaudi Motsoeneng s labour rights. Overall we have rescinded the report and have requested we should have a roundtable with the public protector s office where we want to raise concerns if the report is bridging around issues of employee/employer rights, we should be able to raise that. But we don t believe that taking it on review to the courts will be the best way to conduct this, she said.In her report, Madonsela found that Motsoeneng fraudulently misrepresented his qualifications to the broadcaster, abused his power and acted with impunity by irregularly increasing his salary, among other findings.The SABC is currently presenting its annual performance plan to the portfolio committee on communications in parliament.
