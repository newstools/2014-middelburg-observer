At least a hundred thousand South Africans gathered at the Union Building when opposition parties united to march against President Jacob Zuma on Wednesday, reports The Citizen.Leading the National Day of Action march through the capital city, Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) Commander In Chief Julius Malema took to the stage to remind protesters about the purpose of the march. We are united here to give Zuma his birthday present, he said to a cheering crowd.United Democratic Movement leader Bantu Holomisa referred to a message he received from a concerned citizen regarding apologies from top ANC leaders on their opinion of Zuma s contraversial reshuffle of cabinet. The citizen asked if the top leaders had to apologise that means the country, the Constitional Court, the Public Protector, Cosatu and rating agencies were wrong and Zuma was right. It means the people here are also deemed to be wrong. Earlier this week, Zuma said last week s national shutdown and march against his leadership showed that racism continued to exist in the country.But Holomisa said: We are here united against him. He says this is racism, but do you see any racism here? Democratic Alliance spokesperson Phumzile Van Damme added: They tried to divide us but they failed . They said we are racist. But looking at this, we see all South Africans of all races have gathered here. #NationalDayofAction Joshua Zimmerman says he is a member of EFF and looks up to Julius Malema. #VK pic.twitter.com/Rj9v7n7LsW&mdash; Virginia Keppler (@VKeppler) April 12, 2017 Caxton News ServiceRead original story on citizen.co.za
