Recently axed Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan will have to tighten his own belt as his salary drops by approximately R1 million.Cabinet ministers currently earn about R2 million but members of parliament receive a pay cheque of around R1 million a year.Following his fall from grace after President Jacob Zuma announced his Cabinet reshuffle early on Friday morning, Gordhan will resume his position in parliament.Even though ministers have always been members of parliament, they have not been obliged to attend portfolio committee meetings.This means the fate of Gordhan and deposed deputy Mcebisi Jonas lies with the ANC, who can deploy them to take on any seat, be it in the National Assembly or the National Council of Provinces.This is unless they decide to resign or are deployed elsewhere.Parliament spokesperson Moloto Mothapo said the legislative arm of government did not get involved in the deployment of MPs. That has nothing to do with us. It is the prerogative of parties, he said.While the office of the ANC chief whip could not be reached for comment, DA chief whip John Steenhuisen said his party hoped they would stay on.The party has requested Speaker of the National Assembly Baleka Mbete to urgently consider calling for another vote of no confidence against Zuma. We obviously want them to stay on so they are eligible to vote against Zuma in favour of the motion of no confidence, Steenhuisen said. Caxton News ServiceRead original story on citizen.co.za
