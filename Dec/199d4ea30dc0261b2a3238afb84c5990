It is still unclear what the solution to the violent protests in Coligny will be following a meeting held by different stakeholders on Tuesday morning.Local farmers, community leaders and government officials attended the meeting that was held near the local police station.Addressing the media shortly after the meeting, North West police spokesperson Sabata Mokgwabone was not at liberty to divulge what the meeting resolved except that stakeholders would still have to address local residents at a local sports ground.The area has been tense since the two men accused of killing 16-year-old boy Matlhomola Mosweu were granted bail on Monday.The accused claimed that the deceased was stealing sunflowers when they apprehended him and that the deceased jumped off the moving vehicle they were travelling in, a version that was denied by a state witness during the bail hearing last week.
