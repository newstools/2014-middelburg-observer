Former outspoken ANC MP Makhosi Khoza is reportedly launching a new political party named Change, City Press reports. According to the report, the party will see the merger of a number of local organisations, including the Metsimaholo Civic Association and the Forum 4 Service Delivery. The party will include former Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) members Mpho Ramakatsa and Lufuno Gogoro. Speaking to the paper ahead of the launch of Change – expected to take place on Friday and Saturday in Gauteng – Khoza said her involvement in the formation of the new party had nothing to do with being a disgruntled former ANC member. She said it was about taking the baton from the governing party, which is plagued corruption allegations and factional infighting. “We thank the ANC for its role…It is our view that the ANC accomplished its mission. Now somebody else must take the struggle forward; the baton must be handed over. The ANC is now negating the struggle we fought for,” Khoza was quoted as saying. Change will learn from the failures of parties such as Cope and Agang, she said. The party would also push for radical changes in the country’s political landscape. According to Khoza, the EFF is too radical, Cope is undermined by egos; and South Africans do not have confidence in the DA to lead and unite the nation. Among its objectives, Change will reportedly push for the president and deputy president to be elected directly by South Africans. It also wants the composition of parliament to change to 50% of MPs coming directly from constituencies, and the other 50% from proportional representation. The party’s interim leadership structure is made up of 10 people, and will remain in place even after the founding congress. Khoza will be the leader of Change, and the party’s interim leadership structure will have no hierarchy. Read original story on citizen.co.za
