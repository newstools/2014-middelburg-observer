OR Tambo International Airport has been named African Airport of the Year at the Air Cargo Africa conference and exhibition for the third consecutive year.The award recognised the efforts of OR Tambo International Airport to boost cargo traffic and enhance its status as the leading airfreight hub in Africa, the Kempton Express reported.The Air Cargo Africa event was held in Ekurhuleni last week and attracted a record number of 80 international exhibiting companies, more than 500 global industry decision-makers and more than 3 000 trade visitors from more than 60 countries, including 30 African nations.Bongiwe Pityi, general manager, said the management and staff of the airport were humbled by the award, which underscored their drive to boost cargo volumes. We decided two years ago that we need to focus more on the needs of our stakeholders in order for us to deliver the best infrastructure required for the total air cargo value chain. We are especially pleased that our attention to providing real-time support to cargo stakeholders is beginning to make meaningful contributions to the growth and sustainability of the sector, which is currently under considerable economic pressure, said Pityi.She added the infrastructure to support the airfreight industry would be steadily improved.In the short term, Airports Company South Africa (Acsa) will reconfigure and upgrade the access and frontage roads around the cargo buildings at OR Tambo International Airport to ease congestion and reduce in-transit times.In the medium to long term, plans for a midfield cargo terminal are being aligned with a master development plan for the entire airport precinct.Pityi said the master development plan had a horizon of decades and careful consideration had to be given to integrating plans for infrastructure that will have a potential lifespan of 30 to 40 years.
