ANC MP Mervyn Dirks went on a rampage during parliament yesterday, calling fellow MP Priscilla Mantashe names and flipping a birdie to opposition party members. “He was angry and continued with the insults. I was angry but more hurt, because my mother had just passed on,” Priscilla told EWN. She added he also insulted her brother, Gwede Mantashe. Dirks threatened Priscilla and angrily walked off from the parliamentary seating. Meanwhile, the ANC has condemned the incident. “The behaviour of ANC MP Mervyn Dirks was despicable and not in keeping with the image of parliament and the organisation he represents, the African National Congress. “It is very regrettable that while observing 16 Days of Activism Against Women and Child Abuse, a male member of parliament would threaten to assault a female member in Parliament,” Jackson Mthembu’s office said in a statement.
