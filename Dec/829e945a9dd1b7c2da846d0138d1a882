One person was tragically killed in a horror accident on North Coast Road of KwaZulu-Natal on Saturday at 11pm after a car plowed into several shacks at the Kwa-Mathambo Informal Settlement. The deceased, Grace Nkambule, 67, was sleeping on a pile of tyres when she was run over by the vehicle, the Northglen News reports. According to KwaMathambo resident, Ndodeni Dengo, the grandmother was a well-known member of the community. “We are very sad, she had been living here for many years. On the night of the accident, she had fallen asleep on a pile of tyres at the front of the settlement, alongside North Coast Road. The accident occurred just behind my shack, and I heard a loud sound, almost like a bomb. Then I heard the screams. “When the paramedics arrived, Grace had severe head and back injuries and passed away on scene,” he said. Two shacks were damaged in the accident. Ward councillor for the area Bobby Maharajh said Greenwood Park Police were investigating the incident. “Sadly, Grace was killed on the night, including the driver of the vehicle. The driver of the vehicle was also seriously injured. Police are investigating the cause of the crash,” Maharajh said. On the same evening, two people were killed in a fatal collision at the intersection of Alpine Road and Umgeni Road where two vehicles collided in a T-Bone format. According to Rescue Care’s Ceron Lennox, one vehicle was still on the roadway while the other vehicle has left the roadway and landed in a canal alongside Alpine Road. “Paramedics found one person dead in one of the vehicles including two passengers who were critically injured. Following a two hour rescue to hoist the two seriously injured from the vehicle in the canal, the two patients of which one was a 15 year old boy, were the transported through to hospital,” she said.
