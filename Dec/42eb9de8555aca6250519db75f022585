KWAZULU-Natal provincial police have confirmed a relative of Siam Lee was taken in for questioning on Friday. This follows the discovery of a badly burnt body in a sugarcane field in New Hanover in the KZN Midlands last weekend. Lee had been missing since 4 January and was last seen leaving her workplace at about 3pm on Margaret Maytom. While the family and various role players in search for the 20-year-old have confirmed the body discovered is that of Lee, police say they will continue to wait for DNA results. “We can confirm a relative was taken in for questioning but they were not detained. We were just looking for more information in the case. Although the family have confirmed the body found in the Midlands is Siam Lee, we are awaiting DNA test results before making any pronouncement. “A case of murder is being investigated by New Hanover police for the body that was found in the field. We cannot reveal any more information to the public as the case is extremely sensitive. Police are still investigating the case. No arrests have yet been made,” said Lt Col Thulani Zwane, provincial spokesman for the police. An identikit of the man police believe could help with information on Lee was also released.
