Please fellas, join me, we have to rape their kids with AIDS virus too! [sic]. He later posted Kill the pigs. A campaign has since been launched to find Mcambi, or at least determine the truth behind the origins of the frighteningly violent and racist post.He has since deleted the various posts, but scores of people have reported him to Facebook.

We&#39;re not keen on #racism either. Help find #ObatalaMcambi. https://t.co/ew6soAPTrt&mdash; Egalitarian Party (@EP_RSA) March 11, 2017 I appeal to the South African Police Service to immediately investigate this matter and bring the person/persons responsible for the hate speech, incitement to violence and intimidation to justice, Abramjee told the media outside the police station. I further request that a charge of hate speech, incitement and intimidation be opened and thoroughly investigated. We are sick and tired of this nonsense. The law must come down hard on people like Mcambi. He must be tracked down. Police must investigate the matter as one of urgency and we also need to establish whether Mcambi is his real name, Abramjee added.He said the posts have caused widespread anger. People are also opening charges in other areas. Mashaile said: There is no place for racism and hatred. We want this person hunted down, arrested, charged and punished. I came here to provide an affidavit to police to support the charges opened by Yusuf, a fellow #TurnBackCrime ambassador. Alli said Mcambi must be brought to justice. She said she was not just speaking for all women and children, but for men too. This person must be arrested. These posts are unacceptable. Meanwhile, Mcambi has updated his profile picture with a photo of him with a revolver in his hand. He claims to be self-employed and living in Durban.
