Premier David Mabuza lashed out at the parents of two schools in the area for interrupting school attendance for the past two months in demand of tarred roads, the Mpumalanga News reports.Mabuza held two separate meetings yesterday where he instructed all learners and teachers to return to school as from today, stating it would be safe for them to go back to school as the police would be deployed throughout Bushbuckridge to ensure no child is stopped from going to school.He also urged parents to be responsible and allow children to go to school, saying the police would deal with those who intimidated the learners and the teachers. He said some few suspects had been arrested after they were found in possession of the computers stolen from the schools.However, parents defended themselves and told the premier they deliberately blocked the learners from going to school because they wanted a tarred road. They denied taking part in the torching of school buildings but suspected criminals in the area. Caxton News ServiceRead original story on mpumalanganews.co.za
