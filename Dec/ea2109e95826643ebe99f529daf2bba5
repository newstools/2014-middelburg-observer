Deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa is not impressed with the removal of Pravin Gordhan from the finance portfolio, reports The Citizen.According to eNCA, he said it was unacceptable .Together with secretary-general of the ANC, Gwede Mantashe, Ramaphosa rejected President Jacob Zuma s decision to fire Gordhan and his deputy, Mcebisi Jonas. The first time was on Monday when Zuma informed the top six officials of the ANC, Jessie Duarte, Baleke Mbete and Zweli Mkhize and the South African Communist Party (SACP).The second time was yesterday when the top six were again summoned to Zuma s presidential home in Pretoria to urgently finalise the restructuring of Cabinet. That meeting lasted three hours, and Mantashe and Ramaphosa were again outvoted.Speaking to Power FM shortly after the Cabinet reshuffle, Mantashe said the list of new ministers and deputies was imposed on them. He added, traditionally, lists were debated, but they were told to accept it.Ramaphosa and Mantashe s stances expose the deep divisions within the ANC, with certain factions outright coming forward to disagree with Zuma, further showing he does not have complete control of the ruling party.
