Johannesburg Water has alerted the public about contamination of the water in the Northriding area, Randburg Sun reports.  According to Ward 134 councillor Wendy Alexander, the contamination is suspected to have occurred when a small amount of sewage water mixed with clean water in pipes. Areas affected include Aureole Avenue, Boundary Road, Spionkop Road and Olievenhout Street. Alexander said: “Johannesburg Water confirmed that they are flushing the system with chemicals like chlorine. They said the water is still not fit for human consumption, and won’t be for the next few hours.”  According to Alexander, fresh water tankers have been placed at the corner of Aureole Avenue and Boundary Road in Northriding. “I would like to thank Johannesburg Water at this time for taking these precautionary measures and ensuring that the public is informed.” – Caxton News Service Read original story on randburgsun.co.za
