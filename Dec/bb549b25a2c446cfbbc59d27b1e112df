Between 11 and 15 suspects, presumably armed with AK-47 and R5 rifles, ambushed an SBV vehicle carrying an unknown amount of cash on Thursday afternoon, Lowvelder reports. According to a police report, the incident occurred at about 17:40, on the road coming from Matsulu. It is alleged that a white Mercedes overtook the SBV truck and started firing shots at it. The driver of SBV vehicle then pulled over. “His passenger ran away and was shot in the back. Both guards were disarmed, and an R5 was taken but was later recovered. They then used explosives to gain access to an undisclosed amount of cash and fled the scene,” said Captain Jabu Ndubane. They sped off in the Mercedes, a charcoal coloured sedan and a red Volkswagen Golf. The injured guard was rushed to hospital, and his condition is unknown at this stage.
