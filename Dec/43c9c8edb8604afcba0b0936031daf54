The Gauteng education department has welcomed the Pretoria West High School parents decision to vote against skinny pants, Pretoria Moot Rekord reports.The parents of children going to the school voted against an amendment to the school s code of conduct that would have allowed learners to wear skinny pants. I am encouraged and satisfied with the decision taken by parents, and also wish to encourage other parents to do the same. As parents we must always take charge of our children s behaviour and empower educators to instil necessary discipline to learners, said MEC Panyaza Lesufi.He said ill-discipline should not be tolerated in the school environment.Last week, learners at the school boycotted class demanding the school incorporate skinny pants into the uniform. It is important to note that teaching and learning continues unhindered at the school, and as such we plead with learners not to disrupt schooling because that will impact negatively on their future, said Lesufi. Learners are encouraged to use proper channels to raise their grievances, this will eliminate the need for protests and unnecessary disruption of teaching and learning. We wish the learners well in their studies. Lesufi thanked the school governing body for a swift intervention to put the matter to bed. Caxton News Service&nbsp;Read original story on rekordmoot.co.za
