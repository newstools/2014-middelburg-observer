More than 2 000 rabbits were donated from Benoni Bunny Park to Johannesburg Zoo as food for carnivores. Fifty rabbits were, however, left behind at the bunny park so that visitors could enjoy still enjoy them, but they are not happy with current small number of bunnies, Benoni City Times reports. One of the visitors John Priestley wrote to the media as follows: It saddens me greatly to read about the ongoing saga of our beloved Bunny Park. For a facility that has given joy and happiness for decades to so many children, to be limited to 50 sterilised rabbits in an enclosure, is a travesty. A child might as well sit at home and look at pictures of bunnies and farm animals on a computer screen. The fun was when a child could spend a day outdoors running around clutching a carrot trying to feed the ever-elusive rabbit and seeing farm animals up close. The outing, costing no more than a few vegetables, made it accessible to all. Well done to the council for spending money on the park and making it more attractive, but please don’t let the whole concept of a bunny park be destroyed by the ‘experts’. You cannot but wonder if all these changes means authorities have an ulterior motive planned for the future. Perhaps a housing complex? – Caxton News Service Read original story on benonicitytimes.co.za
