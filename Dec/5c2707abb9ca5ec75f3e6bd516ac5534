It seems as if the drama between law enforcement and civilians is far from over as a man has been caught on camera assaulting a traffic officer. The video went viral on social media, with people being asked to identify the man who got physical with the traffic official for confiscating his driver’s licence. Some Twitter users who tried to identify the accents guessed the incident might have occurred in North West or Northern Cape. This man went as far as getting the officer in a stranglehold and punching him in his face, and following up the whole ordeal with threats such as “ke tla go moera!” and “ke tla go bliksema!” (both mean “I will beat you up!”), and also threatening, “ke tla go kgaola m*rete!” (I will castrate you).
