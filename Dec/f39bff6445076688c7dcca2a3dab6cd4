The Constitutional Court has ruled in a unanimous judgment that National Assembly speaker Baleka Mbete has the power to order a vote of no confidence in President Jacob Zuma by way of a secret ballot, reports The Citizen.The application was lodged by the United Democratic Movement (UDM) in April after Zuma s controversial midnight Cabinet reshuffle on March 30, which saw Pravin Gordhan and Mcebisi Jonas fired from the finance ministry and the country subsequently downgraded to junk status by two global credit-ratings agencies.Mbete had rejected the UDM s request for a secret ballot, and argued in her submissions before the ConCourt that there were no provisions in the constitution and the rules of parliament that gave her authority to hold the vote covertly. She said it would be up to MPs to decide on that. She was mistaken our interpretation of the relevant provisions of the constitution and the rules make it clear that the speaker does have the power to authorise a vote by a secret ballot in a motion of no confidence proceedings against the president in inappropriate circumstances, chief justice Mogoeng Mogoeng on Thursday said. The exercise of that power must be dually guided by the need to enable effective accountability, which is in the best interests of the people and obedience to the constitution. Mogoeng said Mbete s decision was therefore invalid, and must be set aside. He said the speaker herself said she was not opposed to the vote being conducted through a secret ballot.The chief justice ordered Mbete to make all the necessary arrangements to ensure a motion of no confidence is decided by secret ballot, including designating a new date for the motion to be debated .The African Christian Democratic Party, African People s Convention, Cope, DA and the EFF and IFP supported the application, as well as several civil society organisations.Here are the key points from the judgment:ANC secretary-general Gwede Mantashe previously said if the party s MPs voted with the opposition parties, it would be the highest level of ill-discipline and betrayal.
