President Jacob Zuma has told the North Gauteng High Court he will set a judicial commission of inquiry into state capture within 30 days should his review application of former public protector Thuli Mandonsela’s State of Capture report be successful. Last week, at the last minute Zuma abandoned his attempt to send the inquiry into state capture back to new public protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane for further investigation. Now, the president wants Mandonsela’s entire report to be set aside. He also wants Mkhwebane to investigate alleged ethics violations related to accusations that the controversial Gupta family, Zuma’s close associates, influenced Cabinet appointments. Madonsela ordered last year that, within 30 days, Zuma must establish a judicial commission of inquiry led by a judge appointed by the chief justice, but the president took her remedial action on review, as he wanted to be the one to appoint the judge. In his court application, he argued the remedial action undermined the president’s constitutional authority to institute commissions of inquiry. This is a developing story. More to follow.
