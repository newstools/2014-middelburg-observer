The mayor s car in Witbank, Mpumalanga was slipped into the budget, despite assurances that the purchase had been postponed and the tender withdrawn, Witbank News reports.This unfolded during a council meeting. The Executive Mayor, Cllr Lindiwe Ntshalinsthali created a stir last year, when she indicated that she wants a new luxury SUV. The purchase of the mayor s vehicle mysteriously falls under two vote numbers from two different sources of income that when combined form the R1.5 million that they claim was saved from the Municipal Infrastructure Grant (MIG) projects that were reduced, said a furious Cllr Naritha Naidu, Democratic Alliance Caucus Leader in Emalahleni Local Council.The Municipal Manager, Mr Theo van Vuuren reacted and said: I received feedback today and in short it implies that the car as it was brought into the budget is still showing and will by year end either be cancelled or taken into the new budget. To utilise any of the funding reserved on the budget will require a new tender process and a specific decision by the executive mayor. I have instructed the budget manager to budget, at the correct amount, for a mayoral vehicle in the new 2017/18 budget. That budget will be at council during May where that item and all other aspects of the budget can be discussed. Caxton News ServiceRead original story on witbanknews.co.za
