About 1 500 people braved the wet weather on Saturday to peacefully march to the Union Buildings in Pretoria to plead with the government to prioritise the prevention of farm murders. In solidarity with the farmers, AfriForum along with several civil rights organisations and opposition parties took part in the march to submit a memorandum to The Presidency.
The march comes after the recent national #BlackMonday movement last month which saw the country stand up in unity against the killing of farmers. The #BlackMonday movement was established to raise the awareness of the dangers facing those on farms and create a platform for survivors to speak out about their heartache and losses. The participants to Saturday’s march included trade union Solidarity,  agricultural union, TLU SA, as well as opposition parties DA, Freedom Front Plusand the Cope. The memorandum was received by Eddie Ntsoani, a representative of the Minister of Police Fikile Mbalula. “Farm murders are a national crisis and it has to be treated as such,” said AfriForum deputy CEO Ernst Roets. Roets said AfriForum did not believe that the lives of farmers and farm workers were more important than those of other citizens, but that this community was being disproportionately targeted and that the attacks had an extraordinary impact on the country.
