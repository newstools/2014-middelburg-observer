Today marks three years since iconic Orlando Pirates and Bafana Bafana goalkeeper Senzo Meyiwa was shot and killed in an alleged robbery at his girlfriend Kelly Khumalo’s family home in Vosloorus. The case stunned this soccer-loving nation, but the case seems to be no closer to being solved now than in 2014. Fans of the late soccer star have taken to social media to remind everyone that justice has not been served, especially since no suspect has been arrested in connection with his murder.  Police Minister Fikile Mbalula earlier this year promised that the police would soon crack the case. “It is one of my priorities to crack this case with the team. I’m very positive we’ll make arrests, but I don’t want to tip them [the killers] off by divulging the plans we are going to use.” Mbalula was reminded of this promise by a user who requested the minister to assemble an investigative team to solve Meyiwa’s murder.  One Twitter user believed his soul was still restless, while another said he has hope after the truth about anti-apartheid activist Ahmed Timol’s death was uncovered 45 years later. https://twitter.com/HERCULES_DG/status/923456476898889728 A few questioned how it was possible there were four witnesses in Meyiwa’s case, yet no one knew who killed him. https://twitter.com/Makashule/status/923459751966658561  Many South Africans said they had no faith in the SAPS or justice system because police “turn a blind eye” and “killers always get away with murder”.  Three years later, the question with an elusive answer still remains: Who killed Senzo Meyiwa?  For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter Read original story on citizen.co.za
