“After considering, amongst others, the recommendations of the Commission [for the Remuneration of Public Office-Bearers] and the performance of the economy, President Jacob Zuma has accepted the Commission’s recommendations for all categories of Public Office-Bears except for the Magistrates,” Zuma’s office said. Cabinet ministers, their deputies, National Assembly speaker Baleka Mbete, National Council of Provinces chairwoman, members of provincial cabinets, speakers of provincial legislatures and judges are set to get a four-percent salary hike. Members of parliament and provincial legislatures and kings and queens get a slightly higher increase of 4.5 percent, while the chairperson of the National House of Traditional Leaders and full-time deputy chairperson of provincial houses of traditional leaders will receive a five-percent pay rise. Senior traditional leaders will see their salaries hiked by eight percent. A proposal for increases to the salaries of magistrates will, however, first have to be approved by parliament, according to law. “The president has therefore requested parliament to approve that salaries of magistrates be adjusted by 5.5 percent.” – Caxton News Service Read original story on citizen.co.za
