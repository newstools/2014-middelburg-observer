A burglar who stole a big silver pot and a bicycle from a Norkem Park home in Ekurhuleni was tracked down and arrested by security officers on Tuesday, Kempton Express reports. When the homeowner found out about the burglary, the suspect was already under arrest at Norkem Park police. Captain Lesibana Molokomme, spokesperson for Norkem Park police, said: “ADT responded to an alarm activation at a house on George Bester Street around 7am. When they arrived at the house, the suspect, who had broken into the garage, was already gone.” The officers searched the area and spotted a man on Fanie de Klerk Street in possession of a bicycle and a big silver pot. The suspect was arrested and taken to the police station. Molokomme said the homeowner was at work when the break-in occurred. His neighbour called him to tell him that there was a man with a big pot in his yard. He returned home and found that the garage door had been forced open and a mountain bike and a cooking pot were missing. “He was informed by ADT officers that his property and the suspect were at the police station. Arriving at the police station, he identified the property as his,” Molokomme said. The suspect, 26, was charged with house break-in and theft and possession of stolen property. – Caxton News Service   Read original story on kemptonexpress.co.za
