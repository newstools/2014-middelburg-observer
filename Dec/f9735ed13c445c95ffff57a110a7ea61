Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa has described the ANC’s Eastern Cape elective conference as “a festival of chairs”, saying the governing party should be deeply ashamed of the violence that erupted at the conference in the early hours of the morning on Sunday. Addressing delegates at the conclusion of the conference on Sunday in East London, which saw former Eastern Cape provincial secretary Oscar Mabuyane elected provincial chairman, Ramaphosa said using violence and approaching the courts should not be seen as ways to resolve disputes within the ANC, News24 reported. “Last night when I saw chairs flying – a festival of chairs… I immediately said there must be people injured and I wanted to go to hospital,” said Ramaphosa. “This is not the behaviour that is expected of members of the ANC. As the ANC, we have got to condemn violence as a method of addressing our differences and disputes among us. “I say this because when there are problems and divisions among us, its always best that we sit down and talk about our differences, rather than rush to court or resort to violence,” he added. Ramaphosa said while he was on the way to hospital, he was told that the eight injured ANC delegates had been discharged.
