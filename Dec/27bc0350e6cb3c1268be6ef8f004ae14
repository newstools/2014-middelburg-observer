The African National Congress says it has noted the announcement by the speaker of the National Assembly Baleka Mbete on Monday that the motion of no confidence in President Jacob Zuma will be conducted through a secret ballot, reports The Citizen.ANC spokesperson Zizi Kodwa reiterated in a terse statement on Monday that ANC MPs would toe the party line and vote against the motion. The ANC reiterates its stance that we have full confidence in the ANC Caucus and individual members of parliament deployed by the African National Congress. We do not, nor have we ever doubted, their loyalty and discipline in relation to the decisions of the movement, Kodwa said. Accordingly, we have no doubt that this frivolous motion, which has been hyped up by opposition parties as some sort of Damascus moment, will fail like many before it. The motion will be debated in the House on Tuesday at 2pm. Caxton News ServiceRead original story on citizen.co.za
