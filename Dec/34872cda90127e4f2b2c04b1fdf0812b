SASSA is warning social grant beneficiaries to avoid the approaches of fraudsters and not to accede to loan shark demands by borrowing money for useless festivities. SASSA is also alerting beneficiaries to be extra careful and not to fall for a loan shark charm offensive because in January they will be expected to pay back the money, diverting the social grant payment from its intended purpose. Beneficiaries must note that the social grant payment is not meant for a luxury life and also not to be used as a guarantee for loan shark debts. Social grants are meant to enable vulnerable groups in society to afford basic needs and alleviate poverty. Beneficiaries are being reminded that SASSA does not provide financial products such as loans, airtime and electricity. If any financial agent pretends to be a SASSA official they must report such incidents to the nearest police station. Prevention of crime is better than dealing with fraudsters. Social grant beneficiaries must not provide their Identity Documents, social grants payment cards and pin codes to strangers pretending to be SASSA officials. SASSA only operates in offices and not in unannounced door-to-door activities. SASSA wishes beneficiaries and their families a safe and peaceful Christmas and a happy new year.
