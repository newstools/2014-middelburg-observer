According to the Sunday Times, the alleged assault took place around 1am on Saturday morning at a flat in Braamfontein. Speaking to the newspaper, the young woman, Neo Tsele claimed that Mthokozisi got violent after she and her friend started arguing. She told the paper that despite pleas from her friend, Mthokozisi allegedly refused to stop beating her. “He only stopped when he saw his hands were full of blood,” she told the publication. Pictures of the alleged assault, which showed Neo’s bloody lip and a broken tooth, also went viral on Saturday.  Through a WhatsApp voice note, Mthokozisi told the Sunday Times that he was “surprised” by the assault allegations, and claimed he went to the police station to sort the matter out. On Saturday afternoon, Mthokozisi shared pictures of himself on Instagram at OR Tambo International Airport. He said that he was waiting to board his flight back home to KZN. “KZN hope you ready I’m landing at 16:30 King Shaka Airport love you,” he said. In a statement issued over the weekend, Mzansi Magic said it condemned any act of abuse. “Mzansi Magic and Idols SA are aware of social media posts of an alleged incident that took place on November 24. We have, however, been unable to make contact with Mthokozisi Ndaba. Mzansi Magic and Idols SA condemn any act of abuse,” said head of PR at M-Net Nondumiso Mabece Mthokozisi has hogged headlines ever since he lost the Idols crown to 16-year-old Paxton Fieles last Sunday. It was reported that the musician did not take the loss lightly and was receiving “assistance” to help him deal with the emotions. – Caxton News Service Read original story on citizen.co.za
