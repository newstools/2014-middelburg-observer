Seven athletes have been added to South Africa’s preliminary team for next year’s Commonwealth Games, lifting the size of the squad to 23 individuals. While Athletics SA (ASA) confirmed on Thursday it would submit the provisional squad to national Olympic body Sascoc in the first week of January, individuals could be added to the team ahead of the final announcement to be made later next month. “Such submissions will be entirely up to Sascoc to accept,” ASA said in a notice to its members. While 400m world record holder Wayde van Niekerk was set to miss the Gold Coast Games in April with a knee injury, the team included world champions Luvo Manyonga and Caster Semenya, Olympic silver medallist Sunette Viljoen and Olympic sprint finalist Akani Simbine.
