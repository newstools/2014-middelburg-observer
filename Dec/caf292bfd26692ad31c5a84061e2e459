Cape Town s dam levels remain critically low and all water users are asked to reduce their consumption immediately, reports The Citizen.This is according to a statement issued by the City of Cape Town s media office yesterday.The City said consumption was unacceptably high with the latest water usage figures showing consumption was at 634 million litres of collective water use per day.The City yesterday said dam storage levels were at 25.3%, yet only 15.3% of this water was usable. Water users must take note that our dam storage levels have only increased by 0,8% this week, read the City s statement. The City requires all water users to use less than 87 litres of water per person per day in total, irrespective of whether you are at home, work or elsewhere. Level 4b restrictions which came into effect on 1 July 2017 will be used to drive down water usage to 500 million litres of collective water usage per day. Executive mayor of the City of Cape Town, Patricia de Lille, thanked the water ambassadors and encouraged them to think of more creative ways to reduce water consumption. As for the bad apples who are clearly putting their own needs before the needs of our city, we will be engaging with you and clamping down on unjustifiably high water use, she said.Read original story on citizen.co.za
