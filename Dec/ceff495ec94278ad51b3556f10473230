It was “absolute rubbish” that Chris Hani’s killer, Janusz Walus, showed no remorse for the murder of the SA Communist Party leader as the decision not to grant him parole was “predetermined”, Walus’ lawyer Julian Knight told Saturday Citizen yesterday. Justice and Correctional Services Minister Michael Masutha announced yesterday he had again rejected Walus’ application for parole, as a psychologist’s report showed that even though the killer expressed remorse for leaving Hani’s family with no husband and father, his ideas on communism still stood. According to the report, Walus showed no remorse for murdering Hani in 1993. He continued to rationalise his actions and insisted the killing was politically motivated, Masutha explained. “If one has regard to the fact that remorse is a strong feeling of sadness and regret about something that one has done, the report demonstrates a person who sees nothing wrong in eliminating a communist who happens to be a father and a husband.” Knight said he first heard the news on TV as he was not contacted by the minister or the department on Masutha’s decision. He said the minister’s decision was predetermined and showed disregard for the life of a prisoner. “It’s an absolute load of rubbish that Walus showed no sign of remorse. The minister sees it fit to release farm murderers who have committed far more atrocious crimes than Walus, whom he has issues with. “He doesn’t seem to have a problem releasing rapists with life sentences. From a point of view of consistency, it’s ridiculous.” Read original story on citizen.co.za
