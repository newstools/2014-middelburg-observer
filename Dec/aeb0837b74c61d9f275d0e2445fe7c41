Former Miss Benoni 2015 and Blue Bulls cheerleader, Catherine Reynders (23) has come under fire after a video emerged of her allegedly using the ‘k-word’ on someone who apparently stole a phone belonging to her or her friend. Reynders and a second student, reportedly identified as Bodene Benade, have been suspended by the University of Pretoria after the video went viral on Friday. The footage was by accident shared on a WhatsApp study group by a friend, who immediately apologised afterwards. The Cyril Ramaphosa Education Trust (CRET) has withdrawn a bursary given to Reynders. The Cyril Ramaphosa Education Trust awarded Reynders the Best Student of the Year Award in 2015. “The CRET bursary programme has prided itself on its non-racial, non-discriminatory programme that supports disadvantaged students across all races,” CRET said on their facebook page. The Blue Bulls Company stated that it would not condone any form of racial abuse. Read original story on benonicitytimes.co.za
