Management at OR Tambo International Airport is aware of a protest by taxi operators planned for Thursday and has advised passengers to allow for delays and longer travelling times to the airport, reports the Kempton Express.The airport is not one of the six entities that the Mass Taxi Industry Protest Action Committee (MTIPAC) planned to target with its protest activities, but management at the airport understood that certain highways and routes could also be subject to blockades or congestion.&nbsp; We are staying in close contact with the metro authorities and the South African Police Service in order to keep the routes into and out of the airport open, said Leigh Gunkel-Keuler, spokesperson of the airport. However, protest action of this nature is not entirely predictable and passengers scheduled to depart from the airport on Thursday should make every effort to give themselves more time to get to the airport, she said.Airport management also advised passengers travelling on Thursday to follow news updates on the protest action to ensure they are aware of potential delays.Where possible, passengers heading for the airport should use public transport such as buses and the Gautrain.
