As more than 10 000 peaceful protesters started dispersing outside parliament Friday afternoon, some of the poor did in fact benefit from the anti-Zuma march.They included Charlie from Khayelitsha, who relies on collecting paper for a recycling depot. And Friday was a good day as he found piles of it as he dug through one bin after another.Charlie didn t want to give his surname as he was concerned he might get into trouble from local shops in the area.About President Jacob Zuma, he said: Zuma is far away from the people he is giving money to [the Guptas] and he is not doing anything for us. As he was saying this, a woman from a local shop threw some rubbish into the bin, commenting: Zuma should be in this dustbin. Shaiek Abrahams was on the other side of the road also collecting paper.He said: Zuma just has to do better. We are struggling. After the protest, people filled the local restaurants, cafes and bars.Straffard Harris, who was wearing a Save SA t-shirt, said the country shouldn t go backwards. He had marched from the Cape Peninsula University of Technology to parliament.He said the leadership of the ANC had to realise it was time to boot out Zuma and consider purging the Cabinet of useless ministers .Elphia Makeleni, an ANC member, said she had lost faith in Zuma. I voted for him. He s a disgrace. I didn t realise he was going to become the person he is now. Zuma and his entire Cabinet must step down. He just forgot to reshuffle himself, she added.
