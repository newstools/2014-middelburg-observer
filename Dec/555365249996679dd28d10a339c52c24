Good luck everybody #MDS2017 pic.twitter.com/xoX79drsEY&mdash; MARATHON DES SABLES (@marathonDsables) April 12, 2017Mackay sent word to The Citizen from the race on Tuesday that she was fine , having the time of my life and really enjoying the whole MDS experience , although she said she got some nasty blisters which she received treatment for in the medical tent.As though she had predicted that she would get blisters during the marathon, in an interview with The Citizen prior to embarking on her challenge, Mackay had said her biggest challenge would be managing her feet. Blisters, blisters, blisters I know I am going to get them! My feet have been so sensitive during the last few months during traning, said Mackay, adding that she had even watched videos on blister management and seen a podiatrist for advice on how to take care of her feet.Ahead of the race she said she had not recovered from her ankle injury during a training camp in October last year where she had lost her balance, fell and torn her ankle ligaments. She also partially tore her tendon. I don t have any pain but mobility is not 100% yet. I will have to keep a close eye on my ankle, she had exclaimed, however on Tuesday she hadn t mentioned any pain from her ankle, just that it was hot and the course was tough. Temperatures in the desert are said to reach 48.8 C.Mackay had explained before the race that the course was the equivalent of running six marathons in six days in the most inhospitable conditions .Moerieda Mackay.
