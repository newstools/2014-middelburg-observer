Florida police on the West Rand arrested a 25-year-old for housebreaking and theft, Roodepoort Record reports. Detectives Sergeant Owen Mutshinya and Constable Sherwin Mabasa were driving along Westlake Road when they spotted a suspicious-looking male. The man was carrying something concealed on top of his head and had a schoolbag slung over his shoulders with a white box sticking out of it. They approached him and requested permission to conduct a search. They found a screwdriver and a knife on him. They removed the sheet that was covering the item on his head – a microwave – and inside the schoolbag they found an electric toaster. When he was questioned about the property in his possession, he gave various conflicting answers, but eventually agreed to take them to the address where he had stolen them. He took the police to Makou Street in Florida Lake. Surprisingly, the police found out he had stolen the goods from his own mother by forcefully gaining entry to her home. They contacted the mother, who confirmed that her son was not allowed access to her house and asked the police to arrest him. The suspect was arrested for housebreaking and theft and detained at Florida Police Station. He will appear in the Roodepoort Magistrates’ Court soon. – Caxton News Service Read original story on roodepoortrecord.co.za
