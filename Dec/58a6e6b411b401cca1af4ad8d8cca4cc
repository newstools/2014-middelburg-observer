Suspended Eskom executive Matshela Koko allegedly manipulated events that led to a R1 billion contract being awarded to a company that is linked to his stepdaughter. City Press reports that Koko allegedly removed Eskom subsidiary Eskom Rotek Industries’ tender submission from the agenda of a meeting, which prejudiced the company. Senior Eskom executive, Ayanda Noah, during her testimony at Koko’s disciplinary hearing at power utility’s headquarters in Sandton, said the tender submission was expected to be discussed and evaluated by the Eskom board’s tender committee in 2015. However, because the submission was removed from the agenda of the meeting, Rotek Industries was prejudiced. Koko, through his lawyers, reportedly denied that he gave an instruction for Rotek Industries’ tender submission to be removed allegedly because the subsidiary had no capacity to deliver the work. Noah said she was told by a senior Eskom employee who was among those managing the proposal made by Rotek that Koko removed the submission. Noah did however admit that Koko did not tell her this himself. Koko faces charges relating to nepotism and conflict of interest for failing to declare that Impulse International, a company belonging to his 26-year-old stepdaughter, Koketso Choma, was doing business with Eskom Generation when he headed the unit.
