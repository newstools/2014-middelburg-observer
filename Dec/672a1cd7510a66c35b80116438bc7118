Dumisani ‘Mfana’ Ncube is recovering in Stanger Hospital, north of Durban, after he was bitten twice by a large black mamba in the eNsunduzane Reserve in Amatikulu this week.   The brave 48-year-old Zululand father of six, not only fought tooth and nail to slay the predator, but miraculously survived the ordeal. While walking home from work through the sugar cane fields, Ncube was confronted by the snake. ‘I was walking near the Mthombeni Forest next to the river when the snake suddenly struck and bit me on my right ankle. ‘It bit me a second time and when I tried to hit it with my knobkierie, I couldn’t find the head to finish it off and it was already making its escape into the forest. Suffering from excruciating pain, he bravely dragged the snake out of the bush by its tail. ‘I used my knobkerrie and repeatedly hit it. The battle went on for a few minutes but finally I managed to kill it,’ said Ncube. He said the will to live then kicked in and he dragged his body to a relative’s house where he took some traditional medicine for snake bite. ‘My body was in severe pain and I believed it was my last moments.’ He started vomiting uncontrollably and collapsed. He was rushed to Sundumbili Clinic and from there transferred to Stanger Hospital in an unconscious state. Ncube  has regained consciousness but is still under close medical supervision.
