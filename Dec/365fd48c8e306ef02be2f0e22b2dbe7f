The hobo house causing neighbourly upheaval in upmarket Meerensee belongs to controversial South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) CEO Thokozani Magwaza, Zululand Observer reports.Reports that Magwaza has been suspended for being absent from crucial meetings to address the current social grants crisis have been denied. Instead, it was said he had been granted 12 days leave for hypertension.Either way, Magwaza did not respond to the Observer s questions regarding his unfinished house on Krewelkring Street that had become an eyesore and home for vagrants, much to the annoyance of neighbours.Meerensee Community Police Forum member Corrie Pretorius two weeks ago reported that crime had soared in the area after the vagrants moved in. The house in Krewelkring has become a filthy dwelling. It has become problematic, and the CPF is being burdened with neighbours complaints, he said.Ward 2 councillor Christo Botha said: Aside from having become a base for criminal activities, it has become a serious health hazard. There are obviously no running water and sanitation facilities. We have received reports that water is taken from neighbours properties and the inside and outside areas of the half-built house are being used for ablutions. The people living there also get violent and threaten anybody who attempts to approach them. The other significant problem is that it reduces the value of neighbouring properties. Property owners in Krewelkring next to or opposite this house especially battle to find interested buyers because of this problem. The municipality should take urgent steps to address this issue. Owners of such properties should be served with legal notices. City of uMhlathuze Municipality spokesperson Mdu Ncalane said the City would deal with this matter appropriately and follow proper procedures .
