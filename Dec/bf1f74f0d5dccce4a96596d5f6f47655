Social media was not impressed with Miss SA wearing gloves to a soup kitchen in Soweto on Wednesday, reports The Citizen.She was accused of being racist, as she wore the gloves while serving food to black kids. They pulled out pictures of her interacting with animals and white kids without wearing gloves.Nel-Peters saw the negative comments on social media and said she was saddened that her intentions were completely misunderstood. I just want to clear something out. All the volunteers wore gloves on site today because we honestly thought it s the right thing to do, as we were working with food and we were handing out food to young kids. I m sorry about that, I really hope that you can see my heart, and you can see the true intentions that went into today. However, Twitter thought it would be funny to start a challenge in response to Nel-Peters comment about purely wearing gloves to be as hygienic as possible. The #MissSAChallange, where Twitter users post parodies of Nel-Peters glove-wearing, has been trending on Twitter since Thursday afternoon.Nel-Peters also participated in #MissSAchallenge by posting a video of herself challenging Twitter users to join her next week Wednesday for the Maslow soup kitchen drive:Hey SA , here&#39;s my challenge to you&#8230; #misssachallenge pic.twitter.com/MaeT6Q31jJ&mdash; Demi-LeighNel-Peters (@DemiLeighNP) July 6, 2017#MissSAChallenge studying can be hard when you have to consider hygiene pic.twitter.com/QZSn8pbMlo&mdash; Griffiths Mahlangu (@King_Mahlela) July 6, 2017Me looking at twitter #MissSAChallenge cause like ya&#39;ll are dirty pic.twitter.com/HHJJ2ECZjg&mdash; Unathi (@FirstLadyNathi) July 6, 2017When your hands are feeling a bit dry but hygiene always comes first&#8230; #MissSAChallenge pic.twitter.com/UjHuV3CHNE&mdash; wild thots (@amanda_mpedi) July 6, 2017#MissSAChallenge when hygiene is life pic.twitter.com/lLO63oMIuW&mdash; Wandile (@WQamata) July 7, 2017#MissSAchallenge yazi Black Twitter is very committed pic.twitter.com/AXSvi7VSMX&mdash; T@A (@mbulelo_tatana) July 6, 2017 Caxton News ServiceRead original story on citizen.co.za
