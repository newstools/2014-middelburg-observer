The family was called to the scene, and they could not hold their tears and anger when they saw their child wrapped in plastic dead.Meanwhile in Evaton police arrested a 22-year old man for the murder of a 16-year-old girl on Monday. The suspect allegedly wanted to destroy evidence of the murder, as he was found with a heater and tyre, attempting to burn the shack where the incident happened.Police spokesperson Aubrey Moopeloa said: On arrival at the shack, there was smoke coming from the door of the shack where police obtained forced entry. Upon entering, the police found the lifeless body of a 16-year-old girl. Bloodstains were seen all over the floor and curtains. A tyre was found on top of a burning heater. We suspect that the man wanted to burn the shack to avoid arrest. Both the suspects in the two cases have been arrested and charged with murder.
