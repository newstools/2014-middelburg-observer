Daryl Impey was the first to cross the finish line in the 21st edition of the Telkom 947 Cycle Challenge. Calvin Beneke of Team BCX placed second with Eddie van Heerden of Team RoadCover placing third. In an interview with Fourways Review moments after he crossed the finish line, Impey said that he didn’t come to the race expecting too much. He said he put the pressure when cycling on the M1. “It was a pretty hard finish; coming into Steyn City is always tough,” said Impey, adding that he ‘gave it everything’. He explained he came from racing in Europe which gave him a bit of an advantage and said he used his experience to his advantage. “The guys are surprisingly strong,” he remarked. Ashleigh Moolman was the women’s race winner in a time of 2:35:55.  Read original story on fourwaysreview.co.za
