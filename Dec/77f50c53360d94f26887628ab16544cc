Generations The Legacy creator Mfundi Vundla has faced criticism after saying the 16 former Generations actors’ decision to boycott the popular soapie was a “stupid” move. The cast members were axed after demanding high wages, longer contracts and royalties. Vundla was speaking on 702 with former Generations actress Phemelo Motene on Sunday morning when he made the comment, which social media users have termed “arrogant”. The executive producer said the strike that the 16 actors embarked on was fuelled by ignorance and jealousy. “They had a gripe with the SABC, and figured they should target Mfundi to fight that war for them, and I refused. I fought back for what I created.” Vundla went on to say some of the 16 actors’ career was flourishing before suggesting they have since become washouts. “Some of those people’s careers were jumping. Where are they today? They were on an upward trajectory with a show doing very well. “The whole thing was stupid, and it is sad,” he added. The cast of Generations.
