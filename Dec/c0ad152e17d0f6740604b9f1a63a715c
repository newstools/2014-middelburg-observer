Restocking a fridge is usually not a dangerous job, so it was quite a shock when a worker from the local SUPERSPAR came across a huge Rock Python sleeping among the yoghurt on Friday afternoon at about 3pm, the Corridor Gazette reports.Store manager Gert Myburgh says they have no idea how the snake slipped into the fridge. I ve scanned the CCTV footage and couldn t spot it getting in from the front of the store. I suspect it came through a drain in the fridge. The 3.5 metre snake did not move when it was spotted, and the area was quickly cordoned off for customers safety. Luckily, a local snake handler was in the shop and helped to remove it from the fridge, calling in a colleague for help.READ MORE:VIDEO: Leopards attack giant rock pythonCustomers were amazed at the large snake that hid between the milk products in Komatipoort SUPERSPAR on Friday afternoon. Photo: Facebook.The snake was kept in a safe area and released near the fence of the Kruger National Park on Sunday after it had woken up from its hibernation.Myburgh said they suspected the snake followed something into the store, like one of the stray cats that hang around the area. I called the refrigeration guys to come and see if the snake could have gained access through that system and maybe put up a sieve to avoid any such future situations. Over the weekend, many people commented on the situation on Facebook, with rumours also circulating that the snake had been killed instead of released. However, the majority of people joked about the snake s love for yoghurt and were curious as to how the snake managed to get in the fridge.
