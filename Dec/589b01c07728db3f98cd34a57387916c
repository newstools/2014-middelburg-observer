The publishers of journalist Jacques Pauw’s book about Jacob Zuma have received a cease and desist letter from the State Security Agency. The letter demands that NB Publishers withdraw the book from stores and retract parts of the book. Eyewitness News reports that a media statement also indicated the agency was threatening to go to court over the matter. According to the news agency, The President’s Keepers claims Zuma received R1 million a month from a security company without declaring it to the revenue service. Answering questions in the National Assembly on Thursday afternoon, President Jacob Zuma denied allegations that he received the monies, and said it was not his job to respond to the allegations. It is reported the book also accuses presidential hopeful Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma of dealings with a notorious businessman. Pauw is quoted as saying he stands by his work, adding he approached neither the Presidency nor Dlamini-Zuma for a reply because he felt it was too dangerous. “This is clearly not a work of journalism, this is not a story in a newspaper. But even the press makes provision for the fact that if the newspapers, for example, believes that publication can be stopped by asking people for comment, it is justifiable not to go to those persons to get their side of the story.” Dlamini-Zuma’s spokesperson, Carl Niehaus, insists they have no ties with Adriano Mazzotti. “Primarily, this campaign is being funded and run through volunteers, people who do not demand payment for their time, but we do it out of commitment.”  For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
