A security guard was spat at in the eyes by a Mozambique Spitting Cobra at Idamu School in Ezakheni, KZN, Ladysmith Gazette reports. It is alleged that the security guard was opening the toilets at the school when the massive cobra spat at him. The door of the toilet was closed, with the snake inside, and then teachers from the school contacted Ezakheni police. The police contacted local snake expert Fanie Cilliers, who responded to the scene. Fanie searched high and low to find the snake, but it had already made its getaway through holes in the wall. The injured security guard was taken to St Chad’s Clinic for medical attention. It was said by teachers at the school that the man was in severe pain due to the Mozambique Spitting Cobra spitting venom into his eyes. – Caxton News Service Read original story on ladysmithgazette.co.za
