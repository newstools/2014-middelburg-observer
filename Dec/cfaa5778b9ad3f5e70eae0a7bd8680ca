South Durban roads are waterlogged, with cars seen floating in Mobeni as the storm raging over South Durban shows no signs of abating, Southlands Sun reports. Bluff ward councillor JP Prinsloo has set up a  group to deal with issues relating to the severe storm. “It is made up of city officials and resident representative organisations. Wait for the storm to die down before going outside in this weather and don’t risk becoming a victim as well,” said councillor JP Prinsloo. The municipality has been inundated with calls, so it is imperative that we plan to assist where we can. All faults can be reported directly to Zoe Moore on 073 027 5432 or Prinsloo on 083 406 2525. Report all trees and damaged municipal property. If you can assist with the storm aftermath, contact Moore or Prinsloo. Donations of blankets and food would be appreciated.
