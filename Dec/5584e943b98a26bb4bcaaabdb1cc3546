An Endicott resident is fighting for his life after losing control of his motorcycle when he swerved to avoid a collision on Zuurfontein Road, Kempton Park, on April 17, reports the Springs Advertiser.The man, Rudi Seyffert, 36, and his passenger crashed when they were on their way home from work.According to Werner Vermaak, ER24 communications manager, both men were seriously injured. Rudi sustained serious fractures and was airlifted to the Sandton Mediclinic for further treatment, while his passenger sustained serious internal injuries and was taken to a nearby hospital by ambulance, he says.Family spokesperson Louwrette Wiese says Rudi, not knowing how serious his injuries were, tried to stop passing motorists for help but it was some time until someone responded. After a while someone stopped, called ER24 for help and within minutes there was medical assistance on the scene, she says.Wiese says Rudi is currently on life support and in an induced coma in the intensive care unit at the hospital. Both his lungs were injured during the accident and he is in a critical yet stable condition, says Wiese.Rudi also sustained broken ribs during the accident.Wiese says other problems Rudi face include his oxygen level, which is at only 65 per cent. His own breathing is only 35 per cent, she says.During the first operation, the doctors cauterised four ruptures in his liver as they were bleeding.Wiese says the doctors drained 500ml of blood out of his stomach and removed 20cm of his small intestine that was protruding through a hernia caused by the accident. This was done to prevent his lungs from collapsing when they made him sit up straight, she says.He also suffers from a ruptured pancreas and his blood pressure keeps fluctuating.She says Rudi is a strong man and is fighting for his life. His wife Janita, 37, and their four children, aged between three and 12, are suffering from emotional stress and the children are worried they will lose their father, she says.She says the Wiese family is giving the family as much support as they can, but their medical aid limit has been exceeded and they need all the help they can get. Janita is terrified that Rudi will be transferred to a state hospital in his condition, as without proper care Rudi will not survive, she says.
