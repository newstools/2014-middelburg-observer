The Durban High Court has recently sentenced four men to double life imprisonment each for two counts of murder.The suspect, Vusumuzi Myaka, 44, Mabulala Fano Dlamini, 43, Bhuhle Mkhize, 29, and Hlalo Shangase, 27, were further sentenced to five years each on two counts of kidnapping, the Highway Mail reported.KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson Captain Nqobile Gwala said on October 6, 2015, Myaka who was a taxi driver, parked his Toyota Quantum at KwaDabeka taxi rank and left his cellphone inside the vehicle because it was on a charger. When he returned he noticed that his cellphone was missing. He made enquiries with the people in the vicinity and mobilised his three accomplices. They proceeded to a house in KwaDabeka, where Sbahle Ntanzi, 25, and Holizwe Sindane, 29, were kidnapped by the men. She said the men took the victims to the M19 towards Reservoir Hills, where they were stabbed and shot. On the following day, the body of Sbahle Ntanzi was found on the M19 highway and a case of murder was opened at Sydenham Police Station, while the body of Holizwe Sindane has not yet been found, she said.The KwaZulu-Natal acting provincial commissioner Major-General Bheki Langa praised the members for securing the severe sentences at court. This sentence proves that the KwaDabeka detectives thoroughly investigated the case and presented a well-investigated docket to court for prosecution, he said.
