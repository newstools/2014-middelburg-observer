Despite a boycott by senior officers bearers of the Umkhonto weSizwe Military Veterans Association (MKMVA), (or perhaps because of it), the organisation s fifth national conference voted yesterday for Kebby Maphatsoe to continue as its leader, reports The Citizen.Maphatsoe, who is one of President Jacob Zuma s strongest supporters, also had his title changed from chairperson to president of the organisation.The MKMVA has been at loggerheads with a number of former MK commanders some of them opposed to Zuma who formed the MK Council.The council claims that many of the supposed MK veterans in the MKMVA s ranks are not former fighters and many are too young to have taken part in the liberation struggle.MKMVA has deployed its members on a number of occasions in public including to defend the ANC s Luthuli House headquarters and, allegedly, to intimidate South African Communist Party senior leader Solly Mapaila by demonstrating outside his house.ANC secretary-general Gwede Mantashe tried to reconcile the two groups and arrange a joint veterans conference at which leaders would be elected, but the MKMVA went ahead.Maphatsoe said after the conference that all of the delegates were genuine members of MK.
