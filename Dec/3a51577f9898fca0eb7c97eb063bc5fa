MHM Car Wash at the Winchester Green Centre in Johannesburg was robbed of all its equipment on Tuesday afternoon (May 2) at about 4.30pm by three male suspects, Comaro Chronicle reports.It took the suspects less than a minute to clear out the business, drop everything into the boot of their car and flee the scene.The owners of the car wash claim that about R7 100 worth of equipment was stolen. The car wash operates from the parking garage at the centre and the equipment had been packed away by an employee at around midday and left in a garage parking space.Video footage of the incident shows a white Polo GTI driving past the car wash at about 4.16pm. Three minutes later the same vehicle can be seen passing the centre again, and then suspects are seen speeding into the centre against oncoming traffic and park next to the equipment.A man in a red-hooded jacket can be seen jumping out the car and opening the boot while his two accomplices load the equipment into it before they swiftly drive off.One of the owners of the car wash said: Luckily the crime was captured on video, and we got the registration number of the car which is CS30 VV GP. A case was opened at Mondeor police, and the investigation is still ongoing. Winchester Green Centre manager Belinda Hanekom said: The incident was not associated to the centre in any way, and it was the responsibility of the car wash to protect its belongings, as it is a different entity.
