Former Eskom CEO Brian Molefe has been sworn in as an African National Congress (ANC) member of parliament.The swearing in took place in National Assembly speaker Baleka Mbete s office on Thursday morning, according to a News24 report citing two sources aware of the development.Parliament is expected to announce Molefe s swearing in when the National Assembly sits this afternoon.The controversial former Eskom executive was nominated by the North West ANC last week amid contradictions from two branches of the ruling party in Gauteng, who claimed he belonged to their local structures as well.But branch leaders in Hartbeespoort earlier this week produced Molefe s paid members application form from 2011 up to 2015 as evidence that he had been a member in Ward 29 in Madibeng.Speculation is rife that Molefe could be deployed to parliament s portfolio committee on finance, which could pave the way for him to be appointed finance minister by President Jacob Zuma or replace deputy finance minister Mcebisi Jonas.It has also been announced Molefe had quit the board of the Industrial Development Corporation, which is overseen by the deputy finance minister.Newly elected ANC MP Brian Molefe dashed out of the ANC caucus meeting in the company of ANC whips Doris Dlakude and Nyami Booi. pic.twitter.com/8MAxjg6Az1&mdash; Scapegoat (@AndiMakinana) February 23, 2017 Caxton News ServiceRead original story on citizen.co.za
