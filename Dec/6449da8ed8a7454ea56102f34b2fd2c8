Sadly it was a step too far for the Lions as the fairytale finish for coach Johan Ackermann didn t quite materialise, reports The Citizen.The Crusaders beat them 25-17 in the Super Rugby final at Ellis Park in front of a disappointed 62 000 plus crowd on Saturday afternoon.By the time the Lions scored their first try by hooker Malcolm Marx there were just 15 minutes left in the game and the Crusaders were holding on to a comfortable 22-3 advantage.To their credit, the home side they fought like trojans late in the contest and actually managed to close the gap to just eight points, an impressive feat given that they played with only 14 men.Leading 15-3 at the break, the Crusaders had to weather a strong initial onslaught of the Lions but then took control as the Lions lost their direction after flanker Kwagga Smith was red-carded two minutes before halftime for an aerial tackle on Crusaders fullback David Havili.Who was the star in this match?Unfortunately this award has to go to Crusaders No 8 and All Black skipper Kieran Read, who was a thorn in the Lions flesh with his awareness on defence and link play.Key Moments of the MatchPoint scorersLions: Tries: Malcolm Marx, Corne Fourie.
