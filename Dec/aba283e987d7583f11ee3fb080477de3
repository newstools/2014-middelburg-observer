Another pedestrian was killed after being hit by two cars on Thursday night on Beethoven Road near Sillaatsnek in Hartbeespoort, Kormorant reports. “The pedestrian was hit by a Renault Megane around 17:45 while he was seemingly trying to cross the road. After being hit, a second vehicle drove over the man and sped away,” said Romano van der Spuy, spokesperson for the Hartbeespoort Community Policing Forum said. A crowd of about 40 people gathered and started pelting bricks at a father, mother and baby inside the Renault Megane on the scene.

One man in the crowd was arrested for malicious damage to property and the police are looking for more people. A case of manslaughter was opened at the Hartbeespoort police station and witnesses who might have seen the second vehicle that failed to stop, are required to contact the Hartbeespoort police. Three pedestrians were killed here last year and in December an 18-year-old boy lost his leg when he was hit by a vehicle.
