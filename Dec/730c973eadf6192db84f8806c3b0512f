A 50-year-old man was shot in what appears to have been a xenophobic farm attack near Shakaskraal, in KwaZulu-Natal.According to Umhlali police spokesperson Warrant Officer Shaleen Ramlakan, Matthew Kenya Gachoki was on his way home from Umhlali Quarry when he noticed a suspicious silver golf near his driveway on Thursday, the North Coast Courier reported.Gachoki made a U-turn when an unknown number of assailants opened fire on him. He drove into a firebreak in the canefields around his house, said Ramlakan.One gunshot tore through the driver s door of his white Toyota Hilux and three more through the bonnet.While trying to escape, Gachoki apparently lost sensation in his right foot and jumped out of the moving vehicle into the sugarcane. His vehicle rolled, went out the firebreak and landed blocking the entire road. Gachoki suffered a gunshot wound to his right thigh.Unconfirmed reports have suggested that in the days leading up to the attack, Gachoki was confronted by locals telling him to vacate the farm, as he was Kenyan, not South African.Marshall Security s Kyle van Reenen said he was treated and stabilised on scene by Netcare911 before being taken by ambulance to a nearby hospital for further care. A search of the surrounding area was conducted, however, the suspects remain at large, said Van Reenen. Caxton News ServiceRead original story on northcoastcourier.co.za
