Four people had been severely injured, while the truck driver was one of those taken to hospital. “The driver was taken to hospital and some tests will be done so to determine whether he was under the influence of some substance. We cannot confirm what actions will be taken at this moment because clearly the authorities are still investigating the matter, but something must be done,” Maswangayi said. According to ER24 spokesperson Russel Meiring, provincial fire and medical services were at the scene managing the situation. “A fire that had broken out in one of the carriages and begun to spread had been extinguished and traffic had been affected in the area due to the incident,” Meiring said earlier.
