A video circulating on social media shows a car being stolen at Centurion Mall on Saturday, Centurion Rekord reports. Piren Myburgh, 21, said her friend used the car, a blue Citi Golf, on Saturday morning to go to work. “Around 12:00 midday, she was on her way to the car and discovered it had been stolen,” Myburgh said.  She said video footage in her possession shows the thieves committing the crime. One of the video clips in Rekord’s possession shows how the two cars exit the Centurion Mall area, quickly driving through the boom gate. “I’ve spoken to one of the security officers, who said that they often see how people would tailgate another car at the boom gate if they do not want to pay for their parking tickets,” said Myburgh.  The footage shows both passenger doors of a grey Hyundai car opening at the left, staying open for a couple of minutes and then closing again. Seconds later, a man got out and climbed into the Citi Golf and drove away with Myburgh’s car. – Caxton News Service Read original story on rekordcenturion.co.za
