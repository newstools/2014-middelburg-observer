The only reason the African National Congress will have a woman in the top six structure is because she did not compete against a male contender. Had Jessie Duarte gone head to head with a man, this would have resulted in delegates opting to vote for the man. This is according to the ANCWL president, Minister of Social Development Bathabile Dlamini, who told the media earlier today that the ruling party was ridden with patriarchal overtones that had caused the reversal of gains on female empowerment. Dlamini said the ANC had failed the women of South Africa, not just those in positions of power, but ordinary women on the ground in villages and townships across the country. The woman who steered Dr Nkosazana-Dlamini Zuma’s campaign would not take the blame when the media pressed her on the league’s failure to ensure the campaign efforts by the three women vying for the party’s top position were supported and given traction. “She [Duarte] made it to the top six, and we are proud of her, and we know her record. She is one of the senior leaders who are tried and tested. We want to say Comrade Jessie was able to make it because she stood with another woman. “If she was standing with a male, she would have gone under the bus. We would be sitting with an all male top six. Comrade Oliver Tambo must be turning in his grave,” she said. Praising Dlamini-Zuma for contesting for ANC presidency, she said the women’s league never doubted it would be an easy task to elevate a woman to the top spot. – Caxton News Service  For more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.  Read original story on citizen.co.za
