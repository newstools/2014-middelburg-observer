A 66-year-old bus driver from Phoenix transporting passengers from Durban to the South Coast on Monday was held up at gunpoint in an attempted hijacking.The last passenger who boarded the bus approached the driver, and, while pointing a firearm at him, demanded the bus be driven in the direction of the N2, the South Coast Herald reported.The driver complied, driving along the N2 southbound as instructed. However, fearing the worst if he continued, the driver took the Hibberdene off-ramp and drove on to the northbound carriageway, determined to return to the bus depot, said Scottburgh police spokesperson Captain Vincent Pandarum.Angered by the driver s disobedience, the gunman struck the driver with the butt of the pistol. The driver, however, took advantage of the situation. Using the element of surprise, the quick thinking driver braked sharply, sending the suspect sprawling, said Pandarum.With the bus at a dead stop, the driver and grappled with the gunman, wrestling the pistol from him.The bus driver ordered the man off the bus, pushing him along the road towards the rear of the bus. When he was a safe distance away, the driver got back into the bus and drove to the Scottburgh police station, where he reported the matter and handed in the pistol he had taken from his assailant, said Pandarum.The gun, which will now be subjected to ballistics tests, was fully loaded with 15 rounds of ammunition. The tests will determine if the gun had been used to commit any other crimes.Charges of pointing a firearm, attempted kidnapping and attempted carjacking have been registered for investigation at the Scottburgh SAPS.
