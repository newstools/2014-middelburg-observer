Our quest as a nation for inclusive economic growth, including the empowerment of women, the youth, and other members of vulnerable groups should be designed to help us achieve the type of society where everyone has a better life, said Nkuna.In South Africa, women constitute a large proportion of the economically challenged, particularly in rural areas. The National Development Plan (NDP) acknowledges this by taking gender, along with race and geographic location into account by proposing a range of measures to advance women s equality.Brand South Africa s CEO, Dr Kingsley Makhubela, said through various women development and empowerment initiatives, South Africa has begun to undo the dire conditions that marginalised women under apartheid. Our pro women policies and established institutions dedicated to women have over the years facilitated their economic development. The political will and leadership demonstrated by the South African government through the NDP 2030 underscores precisely what is required to help us reach our women and to reinvigorate them to partake in the socio-economic development pursuit of our nation, said Makhubela.This year s International Women s Day is commemorated under the theme Be Bold For Change , a call on all global citizens to help forge a more inclusive, gender equal world.The African National Congress further marked the day under the Be Bold For Change theme.In a statement, the party said, This day provides an opportunity for the international community to actively participate in driving greater change for women and to accelerate gender parity globally.
