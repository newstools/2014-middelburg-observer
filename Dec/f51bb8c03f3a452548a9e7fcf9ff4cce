Phelamandla Petros Myeza, who is accused of shooting a 12-year-old boy after allegedly mistaking him for a monkey, was released on bail of R1 000 on Wednesday morning at the Umzinto Magistrates Court, reports the South Coast Herald.Initially, it was proposed that bail be set at R500, however, Myeza who has 11 children was told that even though he relies solely on a pension, his children could assist in raising the funds needed.Investigating officer Detective Constable Nonhle Nomonde Myende of the Sawoti SAPS Detective Service testified that Myeza was not a flight risk due to his age and if he were to be granted bail, would not face any danger from the local community.The state prosecutor told the court that Myeza unlawfully and intentionally shot and killed Duma, whom he had mistaken for a monkey.Following the shooting, Myeza realised that it was not a monkey he had shot but rather, his neighbour s grandson.Outside the court, Myeza s son, Protus, explained that his father immediately gathered the community and explained what had happened.According to his son, Myeza was stripped of the shotgun apparently because he wanted to commit suicide when he had realised what he had done.The reason behind the shooting: Myeza, who is a farmer, had been told that monkeys were raiding his farm. He fetched the shotgun, and when he noticed movement in a nearby guava tree, he fired a shot.According to his son, monkeys are almost always present on the farm and posed a threat to their livelihood.When he was released, Myeza s family rallied round to comfort him.The court heard during testimony that Myeza still shares a good relationship with Bongumusa s grandmother.Bongumusa s family had promised that, if Myeza was released, he would not be crucified by the family, said Detective Constable Myende.It was pointed out that Myeza is not in good health, as he suffers from high blood pressure and also has poor eyesight.He is due to appear in the Umzinto Magistrates Court again on April 4.Protus Myeza comforts his father upon his release.
