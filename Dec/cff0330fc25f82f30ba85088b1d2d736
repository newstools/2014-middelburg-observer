Molefe was taken to court by Solidarity, the Democratic Alliance and the Economic Freedom Fighters, which wanted his R30.1 million pension payout in 2017 ruled unlawful and set aside. Trade union Solidarity said it wanted Molefe to reimburse Eskom. Head of Solidarity’s Centre for Fair Labour Practices, Anton van der Bijl, said Molefe’s initial early retirement and the subsequent pension pay-out were neither lawful nor within the framework of Eskom’s pension and provident fund. “We demand that Molefe pay back all pension payments and benefits granted to him,” Van der Bijl said on Tuesday. Van der Bijl said Solidarity had added Molefe and Eskom’s board directors as respondents to the case so they can be held liable for the trade union’s legal costs in their personal capacity. – Caxton News  Service Read original story on citizen.co.za
