WHITE RIVER – Interpol estimates that environmental crime has increased by 26 per cent since 2014. Calum MacDonald from Scotland, the chairman of the advisory board of Interpol’s Environmental Compliance and Enforcement Committee, said on Monday that environmental crime continues to increase by 5,7 percent per year. He was delivering the keynote address during the Department of Environmental Affairs’ (DEA) seventh national Environmental Compliance and Enforcement Lekgotla (ECEL), held at Ingwenyama Sports and Conference Resort on Monday. Calum MacDonald “Increased globalisation and corruption means our ecosystems face unprecedented threats,” MacDonald said. “Resources are depleting at an unsustainable rate and biodiversity loss is an even bigger threat than climate change.” He suggested stronger domestic and international legislation. The aim of the lekgotla was to discuss dealing with environmental contraventions in South Africa. Themed “People, Purpose, Passion: the Pathway to EMI Success”, it brought local and international environmental management authorities together. A new Green Scorpions logo, which will in future stand alongside the existing official Environmental Management Inspectorate’s logo, was unveiled and the 2016/17 National Environmental Compliance and Enforcement Report was also presented.  The ECEL was opened by the Department of Agriculture, Rural Development, Land and Environmental Affairs’ (DARDLEA) head, Sindisiwe Xulu, after which Ishaam Abader, deputy director-general of legal, authorisations, compliance and enforcement in the DEA, set the purpose of the conference. The report, delivered by Mark Jardine, provided an overview of national environmental compliance and enforcement activities between April 1, 2016 and March 31 of this year. It includes the work of the Green Scorpions. In total, 2 880 EMIs are deployed across the country, of which 2 577 are national and provincial EMIs and 303 municipal. Of the 2 577 on the national register 1 726 (67 per cent) are Grade 5 EMIs, such as field rangers employed at national and provincial parks authorities. During this period, 416 criminal dockets were handed to the National Prosecuting Authority, in comparison to 293 in 2015/16 and 257 in 2014/15, while 133 final compliance notices were issued in comparison to 58 in 2015/16. The total value of admission of guilt fines, however, decreased from R788 611 in 2015/16 to R393 291 in 2016/17, which could have been due to the fact that an admission of guilt now counts as a criminal conviction. Mark Jardine As part of the week, DARDLEA MEC, Vusi Shongwe, led an outreach to the Boschrand Primary School in Msholozi on Tuesday. The premises were cleaned and garden tools were donated to the learners for use in the school’s garden. A gala dinner and awards ceremony ended off the week last night.
