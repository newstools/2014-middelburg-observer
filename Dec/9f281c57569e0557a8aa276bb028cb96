A company that allegedly offered one of President Jacob Zuma’s sons a R54 million bribe to swing a government contract was reportedly among 13 firms raided by the Hawks last week, according to a report. The Sunday Times reports that Mxolisi Zuma is allegedly involved in Altron subsidiary Altech UEC, which was raided by the priority crimes unit in connection with collusion in a R5 billion set-top box (STB) tender. The 37-year-old and his younger brother Duduzane are the children of Kate Zuma, the president’s first wife who died after committing suicide in 2000. The Hawks’ search-and-seizure raids are said to have followed an investigation by the competition commission. After Sunday Times reported in August about the bribery scandal and Mxolisi’s alleged attempts to use his father’s influence to swing the contract in favour of Altech UEC, the DA called on former communications minister Ayanda Dlodlo to publicly release the report into investigations relating to the tender process of the state-sponsored STB. National Treasury was also requested by Dlodlo’s predecessor, Faith Muthambi, to probe allegations of major irregularities in the procurement process for the assembly of 1.5 million STBs in 2015. PwC investigated the claims and in 2016 its report was handed to Muthambi. Read original story on citizen.co.za
