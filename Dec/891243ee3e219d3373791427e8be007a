While dodging potholes has become the norm for drivers, it recently left a cyclist with two cracked ribs, a fractured collarbone and numerous abrasions to his body in KwaZulu-Natal, the Zululand Observer reports.Doctor Andy Grant was badly injured after hitting a pothole on President Swart Street and Durnford Road intersection in Empangeni. I was cycling along President Swart, heading up towards the main road. Just after the traffic lights on President Swart Street, I saw a hole in the road that I tried to avoid, he said.In the process of trying to miss the dreaded pothole, Dr Grant subsequently had both his tyres punctured by a smaller pothole. The last thing I remember was trying to swerve. I fell and must have slid for about 20-30 metres, he said.Charmaine Strydom of uMhlathuze Fire and Rescue Services, on her way to work, found Dr Grant lying on the side of the road. He was unconscious, and I quickly went to the home of a Mounties paramedic, who lives close by. It wasn t long before he regained consciousness, but was extremely confused, she said.Dr Grant was rushed to the Life Empangeni Private Hospital, where he was immediately attended to. An accident like mine could happen in the best city in the world, however, I still feel the municipality needs to put a time limit on fixing potholes. Perhaps there should be a phone-in line where residents can report potholes, he said. Caxton News ServiceRead original story on zululandobserver.co.za
