However, it was ready to attack and spit venom into the woman s eyes.The snake was captured and killed by family members.Emergency personnel stabilised the woman before transporting her to hospital.Apparently, Mozambique spitting cobras can accurately spit their venom eight feet. Don t hassle snakes rather let them escape. They don t want to pick a fight with you, as you are too big to eat. Snakes have poor eyesight, but can detect movement, so stay still. It isn t a good idea to try and kill a snake.If you are close enough to whack it, you are within its striking range. Caxton News ServiceRead original story on ladysmithgazette.co.za
