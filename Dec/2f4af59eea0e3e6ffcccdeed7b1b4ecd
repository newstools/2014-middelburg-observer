Police say a woman was taken to the Bekkersdal Cemetery, on the West Rand, where she was gang-raped,  Randfontein Herald reports. Linkie Lefakane, Bekkersdal Police spokesperson, said: “It is alleged the victim was enjoying herself at a local tavern when a group of men offered to take her home. “She allegedly refused, and one suspect would not accept that. He started pulling the victim from the inside of the tavern and dragged her to the Bekkersdal cemetery, where three of his friends joined, and all took turns in raping the victim,” Lefakane said. The victim reported the matter to the police, and a case of rape was registered. The victim, however, saw one of the suspects, and she contacted the investigating officer. Warrant Officer Mohanoe Makona and Constable Lucia Montwedi swiftly responded to the call and apprehended the suspect in a hiding place in Spooktown. A 33-year-old man was then arrested by the Carletonville Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offences Units (FCS). “He will be charged with rape, and is expected to appear before the Westonaria Magistrate within 48 hours,” adds Sergeant Linkie Lefakane. Acting station commander Lieutenant-Colonel Benitta Shibiri urges residents specifically women to avoid staying late at liquor places, as they are being targeted and become victims of violent crime. “Let us all be responsible citizens and fight crime by reporting it as it happens”, she added. – Caxton News Service Read original story on randfonteinherald.co.za
