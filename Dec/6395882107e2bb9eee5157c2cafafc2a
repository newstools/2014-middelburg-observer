A group of youth presumed to be ANCYL members just arrived marching outside Luthuli House ANCheadquarters, reports The Citizen.More youths and ANC members being bused in and offloaded at Beyers Naude Square in central Johannbesburg joining the crowd sitting on the square. Members of MK still surrounding the ANC head office building and dancing to freedom songs while in a guard of honour format. Other MK ex-combatants are standing strategically at street corners apparently awaiting for any eventuality.Riot police are on standby outside the party office. So far the situation is peaceful but noisy as different groups of ANC supporters sing and dance in the streets and on the Square, named after the late Afrikaner anti-apartheid and human rights campaigner and theologian, Dr Beyers Naude.The Johannesburg City itself is almost empty as people appeared to have responded to the call to march and protest in a united call for President Jacob Zuma to step down.Many businesses including shops are closed in the CBD. Streets in nearby usually bustling Mayfair and Fordsburgs commercial hubs nearby are emptyBut one thing for sure, no anti-Zuma protester would dare to come near Luthuli House otherwise they would be met with imminent violence by the crowd some of whom are armed with golf clubs, knobkiries and sjamboks.
