It will be another six months before the construction of a second pipeline commences to double the feed supplying the Goedertrouw Dam in KwaZulu-Natal from the uThukela Rivers, reports the Zululand Observer.The completion date is now set for November next year.This according to the Department of Water and Sanitation during an on-site media tour on Monday.The tour started at the Madungela Pump Station next to the uThukela River at Middledrift and finished at Goedertrouw.Department of Water and Sanitation s National Water Resources Infrastructure Paradzai Muneka addresses the media. Picture: Larry BentleySteps already taken by the department to address the acute water shortage owing to the two-year drought include construction of the Alkantstrand desalination plant and implementing of water restrictions.Increasing the height of the Goedertrouw Dam wall is also a possibility, but it is considered a long-term project, and will not address the immediate water shortage problem.The laying of the second pipeline will increase the volume delivered to the Goedertrouw Dam to 210 megalitres a day.The low-lift pumps in the uThukela River at Middledrift Picture: Larry BentleyA second pipeline will be laid from the low rise pumps in the river to the Madungela Pump Station and from the Mkhalazi High Lift Pump Station to the outflow into a tributary of the uMhlathuze River from where the water gravity feeds the dam.The pipe between the Madungela and Mkhalazi Pump Stations is large enough to carry the extra water.Issues being addressedThe communities that receive water from the scheme are concerned about the quality of the water.Issues still being addressed are the building of two pedestrian bridges and a vehicle bridge across the river as the second pipeline will increase the level of the stream, making it difficult for local communities to cross.The pedestrian bridges are included in the R650 million allocated for the project, but funding for the vehicle bridge will need to be sourced, hopefully from the Department of Transport.Pumps inside the Madungela High Lift Pump Station.
