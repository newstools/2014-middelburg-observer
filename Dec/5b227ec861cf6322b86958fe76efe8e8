The South African Weather Service (SAWS) has issued a warning ahead of the ‘intense cut-off low system’ that will affect parts of the country and KwaZulu-Natal today. Several areas of Durban North and uMhlanga have been adversely affected by the heavy storm sweeping across the coast. It first broke this morning on Durban’s south coast, bringing traffic to a standstill. The old Durban ariport has been flooded and several cars have been abandoned due to the high waters.  Several manhole covers in the Effingham and Greenwood Park areas were ripped open. There have also been reports of flooding, trees uprooted and falling branches in several areas, effectively shutting down road usage.  eThekwini spokesperson, Tozi Mthethwa, has urged all residents to stay indoors until the storm passes. “Residents are also cautioned against driving or walking anywhere for the duration of the storm. The current wind has been measured at 70 kilometres per hour, and is extremely dangerous,” she said. There are reports of roofs that have been ripped off buildings in central Durban and Isipongo.   – Caxton News Service Read original story on northglennews.co.za
