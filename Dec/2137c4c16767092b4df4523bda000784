Cleanup operations along Durban s beachfront will continue on Tuesday as authorities determine the extent of the damage caused by tidal waves that battered the promenade on Sunday, reports the Berea Mail.The eThekwini municipality began the major cleanup operations at 6am on Monday, paying particular attention to the areas outside the restaurants that make up the commercial zone along the beach promenade.Acting MEC for cooperative governance and traditional affairs Bongi Sithole-Moloi, together with eThekwini chairperson for community services committee Councillor Zama Sokhabase, led the disaster teams in assessing the damage.Sithole-Moloi, who went on to urge the public to stay away from the beaches that would remain closed, said: The rough seas have caused damage largely to some of the infrastructure along eThekwini s coastline. We have taken stock of the damage and deployed additional teams to speedily restore the situation back to normality. We are grateful that the worst is over, however, we will continue to monitor the situation. The costs of the damage will be calculated as soon as assessments have been completed. Some sections of piers and promenade remain closed to the public due to unsafe conditions. All Durban beaches including the Battery Beach, Country Club Beach and eThekwini Beach will remain inaccessible to beachgoers until the rising spring tide completely subsides. Councillor Sokhabase said: Officials from the Durban Solid Waste and Parks Department are working along all affected beaches cleaning up debris, litter and large volumes of sand that has been washed up on the promenade and car park area. We are appealing to beachgoers to heed the warning of lifeguards and refrain from swimming until beaches have been reopened. A 24-hour patrol has been put in place in the interest of safety.
