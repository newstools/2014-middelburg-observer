It has emerged that the recently suspended acting MD of Metrobus, Sabata Makoele, may be facing criminal charges following four forensic reports into the company s finances, reports The Citizen.The reports, on investigations carried out by forensics company NEXUS, detailed how Makoele allegedy flouted the tender process and mismanaged millions in public funds while he was the municipal entity s chief financial officer.Surprisingly, he was only suspended earlier this month, two years after the reports were completed and, according to Metrobus, the suspension had nothing to do with any of them.Makoele was suspended pending an investigation into a R3.2 million contract he awarded in April and other supply chain management processes over the past 12 months .The reports make several allegations against Makoele, including financial misconduct, flouting tender processes and corruption amounting to nearly half a billion rand.One report made several adverse findings relating to a tender for a fuel supply contract awarded to Masana Petroleum Solutions in 2012. It found that Makoele flouted the Municipal Finance Management Act and was responsible for R260 million in irregular spending on that contract alone.It also found that Masana owed the city nearly R800 million for two occasions in which the city allegedly invoiced Metrobus for diesel that was not delivered.City of Joburg spokesperson Siyanda Makhubo said new criminal charges had not yet been filed following the latest allegations. The case can only be opened after the outcome of the forensic investigation. Anyone with information can bring it to the investigator or to the city s group forensic and investigations. Right now they are allegations that need to be investigated and verified, he said.The current investigation was still at a preliminary stage but according to Makhubo, Metrobus was expecing it to be completed in three months. Metrobus has finalised the terms of the investigation and are in the process of appointing an independent investigator, he said. Caxton News ServiceRead original story on citizen.co.za
