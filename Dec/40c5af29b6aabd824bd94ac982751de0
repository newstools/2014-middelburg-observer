The head of the teenager who was brutally murdered in Nikhwe near Bizana in KwaZulu-Natal has been found, weeks after her body was discovered, South Coast Herald reports. A 30-year-old man was arrested and appeared in the Mbizana Magistrate’s Court. The grisly murder left residents shocked and angry, and has led to several protests in the town. The teen’s body (including her genitals) had been stabbed several times and her head was missing. According to the residents, a woman had confessed that her boyfriend, who was not from the area, had told her he had been instructed to find a teenager’s head in order to become wealthy. The woman had reportedly gone to visit relatives and upon her return, heard that the teenager had been killed. She then came forward with what her boyfriend had told her. The girl’s family said although they were still distraught, at least they would now be able to lay her to rest properly. Police spokesman Captain Edith Mjoko confirmed the arrest.
