The fallout from the Steinhoff scandal continued on Monday after the South African Rugby Union (Saru) confirmed that the embattled organisation has withdrawn its sponsorship of the Blitzboks. In all honesty, the move wasn’t actually too surprising after speculation had been rife leading up to the new year. “We have been kept informed by Steinhoff of their thinking and they have confirmed their intention to withdraw from their sponsorship of Sevens rugby with immediate effect,” said Jurie Roux, Saru’s chief executive. “It has been completed amicably and by agreement. We’d like to thank Steinhoff for their commitment and support over the past two seasons.” That loss of income doesn’t come at a particularly good time for Saru, who themselves are experiencing massive financial challenges. However, the Blitzboks’ continued excellence means they are the one SA Rugby commercial property that is hot. “We believe all our national teams have characteristics, values and a unique South African DNA that makes them highly attractive to commercial partners,” said Roux. “The Springbok Sevens team has added to that with consistently high standards of performance as the current holders of the HSBC World Rugby Sevens Series title and we believe they will be an attractive proposition for potential partners.” For more sport your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter.
