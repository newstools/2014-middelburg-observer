Police Minister Fikile Mbalula announced on Twitter of Friday that he had landed after a visit from Singapore, an announcement that did not impress one of his followers, reports The Citizen. Good morning, South Africa, the minister of police has just landed from overseas, Mbalula wrote.One of his followers criticised him and said he was only making such announcements because he was safer than the rest of South Africans. And you got VIP protection, hence you re safer than the rest of us re airport followings and muggins. It s a problem, minister, the follower wrote.The minister was equally not impressed with the follower for being cynical when addressing important matters. SAPS has a full operations police station at the [OR Tambo International] airport, it works, must be strengthened, Mbalula said.The follower was not the only one to complain about crime at the airport. EFF leader Julius Malema recently shared on social media how embarrassing it was that the airport had become a playground for criminals.Malema s comment came after a string of reports about crime at the airport and said he had complained about it, but nothing was happening.Though some of his followers agreed with him, some said he was contradicting himself after, in a series of tweets, praising Police Minister Fikile Mbalula, saying he was a reliable activist .
