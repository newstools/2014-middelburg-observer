Patients who were once at Life Esidimeni mental care facility are now at the Clinix Selby Park Hospital and are reported to be receiving good treatment, Randburg Sun reports.DA Shadow MEC for Health Jack Bloom said in a statement that he, along with his colleague Dr Neil Campbell, were informed that the hospital in the inner city of Johannesburg had 380 former Esidimeni patients at the time of their visit.The hospital had 15 more patients by end of April. Five patients have since been admitted to the hospital, and the rest will be moved to the hospital as soon as they have been stabilised and cleared at the acute centre. I am pleased that the patients are receiving good treatment and that about half of them can be rehabilitated to go home or to an assisted living facility, said Bloom.The Gauteng health department and the Clinix Selby Park Hospital agreed to a renewable four-year contract in hopes to provide better care for the patients.It is reported that this contract makes it possible for the hospital to spend R15 000 a month on each patient. This amount is significantly more than the previous R10 000 per patient under the contract with Esidimeni, which was eventually cancelled after the tragic loss of over 100 patients. I am relieved that the patients will all be well looked after but there is slow progress in bringing to account those responsible for the deaths of more than 100 patients, Bloom said in a statement last month.The Clinix Selby Park Hospital has a team of medical doctors, four psychiatrists, occupational therapists, social workers and dieticians. The hospital has large grounds suitable for recreation and gardening. We saw a gym facility and table tennis, soccer tables and a library are also available, Bloom added.
