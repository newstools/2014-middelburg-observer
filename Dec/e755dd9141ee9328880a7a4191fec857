Kruger National Park (KNP) management expressed its heartfelt condolences to the family of one of its own, Frank Mabasa, who passed away last month at the age of 49, reports the Letaba Herald.The public has also expressed its affection for the late Mabasa, and condolences have been pouring in on social media platforms such as the SA National Parks Facebook page and other forums since his passing.Of particular interest to conservationists and experienced birders was that although Mabasa was not a trained and qualified field guide, he impressed guests for being one of the most competent and knowledgeable bird guides they had ever come across.Mabasa was not only articulate, but also knew the calls of birds and would provide additional and interesting facts of the species to those visiting the site. In his 29 years of service in the organisation, Frank ranked as one of the most dedicated and conscientious staff members in the history of the KNP. An amazing human being and a legend in his own right, we have not just lost a hard working attendant at the picnic site but an expert who, regardless of his educational background stepped out of his comfort zone to study what he loved: &#8216;his birds&#8217;&#8230; We will dearly miss him, said the KNP managing executive, Glenn Phillips.Mabasa joined SANParks in 1988 as hut attendant at the Skukuza Rest Camp.After eight years, he moved on to become petrol attendant for two years and later transferred back to the hut attendant position at the same camp.In 2000, Mabasa moved to Pafuri Picnic Spot as picnic spot attendant and worked there until he passed away.A memorial service in Frank s honour was held on April 27 and he was laid to rest on April 29, 2017 at Matiyani, a village outside Punda Maria Gate.
