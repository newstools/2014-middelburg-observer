The ANC’s leadership battle has become a two-horse race, with Ramaphosa and Dlamini-Zuma claiming the majority of support from branches across the country. At the weekend, the Gauteng leadership of the ANC announced it was backing Ramaphosa, who also has the support of the Northern and Eastern Cape provinces. However, Dlamini-Zuma is also pushing ahead strongly, with the Free State and North West provinces expected to give her the go-ahead to possibly make history and become the first woman president of the ANC. ANC head of policy and Minister in the Presidency Jeff Radebe and Human Settlements Minister Lindiwe Sisulu’s campaigns to be nominated for the party presidency have lost steam, according to The Sowetan. The newspaper reports they are not making an impact, and instead, ANC treasurer general Zweli Mkhize has received a few nominations from branches. Mkhize has become more visible and critical of the party’s leadership. “When people criticise the ANC, we must accept that they are not lying. “They say we have leaders who are seen to be arrogant … we need to prove to them that we are worthy of being elected,” he said while addressing a meeting in Kagiso about a week ago. In the Free State, 20 branches have declared their support for Dlamini-Zuma, with 15 backing Ramaphosa. – Caxton News Service Read original story on citizen.co.za
