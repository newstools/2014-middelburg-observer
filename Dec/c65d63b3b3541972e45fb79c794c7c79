The Lions have already donated R5 000. Phone Cllr Sean Snyman for more information on 072 908 3413.Snyman said the biggest need now is &#8220;lots and lots of food&#8221; and warm clothes and blankets, or even towels that can be used to wrap children.&#8220;The need for accommodation is secondary. Most of the people who have been evacuated have already found a place to stay. We will be coordinating with Eden Disaster Management to get a list of where each evacuee is being accommodated as we are getting lots of calls from people looking for friends or family,&#8221; said Snyman.&#8220;We urge people not to drive to Knysna with donations on their own. It will be chaos. Rather bring your donations to us. We are sending vehicles in convoy. People with bakkies are welcome to come to us and drive through as part of a convoy. We are keeping record of where everything is taken to.&#8221;People who want to make cash donations, can also phone Louise Hook from Eden Disaster Management on 044 803 1341.In George, items can also be dropped off at:* George Herald: 72 York Street or 13 Ring Road, George Industria;* Methodist Church, Plantation Road, Glenbarrie;* Bergsig Dutch Reformed Church, corner of Meyer and Fourth Street; and* Bergsig Neighbourhood Watch office, corner of Knysna Road and Fifth Street;* Kraaibosch Shell Garage; and* Curro Castle George.In surrounding towns, items can be dropped off at the Group Editors newspapers:* Mossel Bay Advertiser, 9 Kerk Street, Mossel Bay;* Knysna Plett Herald: 19 Spring Street, Knysna or 6 Park Lane, Plettenberg Bay;* South Cape Forum, 29 Heidelberg Road, Riversdal;* Oudtshoorn Courant, 70 Voortrekker Road, Oudtshoorn;* Graaff-Reinet Advertiser, 11 Kerk Street, Graaff-Reinet.Other drop-off points in Knysna:* Knysna Fire Department, Waterfront Drive; and* Metelerkamps, 3 Union Street, Waterfront Drive, (opposite Knysna Fire Department).George Hospital on standby Dr Zilla North from the George Hospital said they are on standby to assist with emergencies from Knysna.&#8220;Knysna Hospital survived, but has been evacuated to Knysna Life Hospital.
