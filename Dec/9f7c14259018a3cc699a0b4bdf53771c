The Congress of SA Trade Unions (Cosatu) on Tuesday called for President Jacob Zuma to step down from office, saying it no longer believed he was the right person to unite and lead the tripartite alliance movement, reports The Citizen.Addressing the media in Johannesburg following a special meeting of its central executive committee (CEC), the trade union federation s general secretary Bheki Ntshalintshali said for the first time under Zuma s leadership they were not consulted on the Cabinet reshuffle.Ntshalintshali said Zuma s changes to his executive team were not based on merit but on political loyalty because he failed to deal with some of the most incompetent ministers in his Cabinet.He also said Cosatu was still committed to the alliance and they would not support the Democratic Alliance s (DA) marches against the president, unless the DA protested against Western Cape Premier Helen Zille s colonialism tweets.On Monday, S&amp;P Global lowered South Africa s long-term foreign currency sovereign credit rating to junk status, Cosatu expressed its disapproval of the credit rating agency s decision, saying it was worried this would affect the country s inflation, particularly an increase in borrowing costs.Ntshalintshali said Cosatu was unapologetically supportive of the efforts to transform National Treasury and the reserve bank , adding they were angry that in our country, we have more than nine million people unemployed .He said there was no finance minister who has been a friend of the workers , including axed National Treasury chief Pravin Gordhan.On Friday, the SACP released an official statement confirming they no longer supported Zuma as well.Read the statement from the CEC below:COSATU Presser statement pic.twitter.com/J1SiYkrzvq&mdash; @COSATU Today (@_cosatu) April 4, 2017 Caxton News ServiceRead original story on citizen.co.za
