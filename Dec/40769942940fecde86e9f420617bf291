How many of us have said: Mother s Day is coming up and I have to get my mom that pair of shoes she was looking at the other day? The problem is that the shoes are only available online and can t be purchased locally. So what do we do? Buy them online, using our credit cards, reports the South Coast Herald.But it isn t that easy anymore, is it? The problem nowadays is that we can buy and pay for just about anything online.The shopping industry has opened itself up to buyers in the most convenient way imaginable.We can now buy food, electricity, clothes and whatever else we d like online just by entering our credit or debit card details.With that convenience, we as online shoppers have also opened ourselves up to all sorts of criminals. Is the site I want to buy the shoes from legitimate, because it has no business address listed and no authentic looking email address or contact details.See, the thing is, I know what to look out for, but do you?Don t fall victim to online scams or fraudulent websites. If you have an internet connection, you can educate yourself on online safety. Ignorance is no longer an excuse. Caxton News ServiceRead original story on southcoastherald.co.za
