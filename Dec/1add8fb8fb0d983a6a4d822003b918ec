The Free State is the latest province to back former African Union (AU) chairperson Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma for the ANC top job following its provincial general council meeting in Parys on Tuesday night. Mpumalanga premier and ANC provincial chairperson David Mabuza was announced as her deputy, Ace Magashule for the secretary-general position, International Relations and Cooperation Minister Maite Nkoana-Mashabane as treasurer-general, Arts and Culture Minister Nathi Mthethwa as the chairperson, while Jessie Duarte was nominated for deputy secretary-general position. According to EFF leader Julius Malema, the people who were nominated in Dlamini-Zuma’s slate were picked so they could pull the numbers for her. He has previously advised that Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa include Mabuza as he had a “whole province” behind him, but it seems the Dlamini-Zuma camp made the move first. The Sowetan has reported that Dlamini-Zuma has garnered the support of 206 branches, while 44 branches were behind Ramaphosa. The ANC in Ekurhuleni recently said it would support Dlamini-Zuma to succeed her former husband when he steps down at the December elective conference. Regional executive committee (REC) chairperson Robert Mashego told News24 their backing of Dlamini-Zuma was due to her “unwavering commitment” to radical economic transformation. However, the region has reportedly admitted it had yet to consult its 111 branches that would nominate candidates for the ANC’s leadership race. The REC is said to prefer current ANC secretary-general Gwede Mantashe and the party’s Gauteng chairperson, Paul Mashatile, to be elected national chairperson and treasurer-general, respectively. – Caxton News  Service   Read original story on citizen.co.za
