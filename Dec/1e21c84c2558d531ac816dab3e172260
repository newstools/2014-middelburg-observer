Residents in various parts of the country, including Gauteng, should brace themselves for the first cold snap since the start of winter, the South African Weather Service said yesterday, reports The Citizen.In recent weeks temperatures have been dipping. Maximums have dropped to between 10 C and 11 C in Gauteng, which has signalled the coming cold.Speaking to The Citizen yesterday, forecaster Dipuo Tawana said the significant drop in minimum temperatures expected in Gauteng as of Wednesday will make it difficult for daytime temperatures to recover.Minimum temperatures in the province are expected to range between -2 C and -4 C in Vereeniging on Wednesday, between 0 C and 2 C in Johannesburg, and between 2 C and 3 C in Pretoria.The areas in question are expected to reach peaks of between 14 C and 19 C. Elsewhere, minimum temperatures are expected to drop below 2 C in the Free State and the southern parts of North West.Limpopo and Mpumalanga can expect to feel the effect of the drop in temperature from Friday.For Western Cape, significant rainfall is on the cards as a cold front is expected to make its landfall early in the week.According to Tawana, an advisory has been issued for the possibility of heavy rainfall which may lead to flash flooding. Because the southern parts have been very dry, it will not be easy for the rain to infiltrate the ground, she said.Possible snow will hit high-lying areas and gale-force winds will buffet the coast.
