The first suspect in the murder of Shaynice Talla has been released and another man arrested, Soweto Urban reports. According to Eldorado Park police spokesperson Captain Phillemon Khorombi, the first suspect could not be linked to the case. While her brutal murder has created a furor within the residents, the arrest of a second suspect is sure to leave the family reeling in shock. The second suspect has been arrested, and it turned out to be the four-year-old’s uncle. The 26-year-old suspect was arrested, and appeared in court on October 4, but the case was remanded to October 13. He has been charged with murder, and the rape allegations are still under investigation while police wait for a report from the forensic pathologist. The findings of the report will indicate definitively whether any sexual assault occurred. Khorombi said the same suspect was involved in an unrelated case of assault with the intent to cause grievous bodily harm. – Caxton News Service Read original story on sowetourban.co.za
